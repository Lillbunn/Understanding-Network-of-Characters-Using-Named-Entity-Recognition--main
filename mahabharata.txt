AUTHOR'S PREFACE 
 
IT is not an exaggeration to say that the 
persons and incidents portrayed in the 
great literature of a people influence 
national character no less potently than 
the actual heroes and events enshrined in 
its history. It may be claimed that the 
former play an even more important part 
in the formation of ideals, which give to 
character its impulse of growth. 
In the moving history of our land, from 
time immemorial great minds have been 
formed and nourished and touched to 
heroic deeds by the Ramayana and the 
Mahabharata. 
In 
most 
Indian 
homes, 
children formerly learnt these immortal 
stories as they learnt their mother tongue 
at the mother's knee. And the sweetness 
and sorrows of Sita and Draupadi, the 
heroic fortitude of Rama and Arjuna and 
the loving fidelity of Lakshmana and 
Hanuman became the stuff of their young 
philosophy of life. 
The 
growing 
complexity 
of 
life 
has 
changed the simple pattern of early home 
life. Still, there are few in our land who do 
not 
know 
the 
Ramayana 
and 
the 
Mahabharata. Though the stories come to 
them so embroidered with the garish 
fancies of the Kalakshepam (devotional 
meeting where an expert scholar and 
singer tells a story to his audience) and the 
cinema as to retain but little of the dignity 
and approach to truth of Vyasa or 
Valmiki.  Vyasa's Mahabharata is one of 
our noblest heritages. And it is my 
cherished belief that to hear it faithfully 
told is to love it and come under its 
elevating influence. It strengthens the soul 
and drives home, as nothing else does, the 
vanity of ambition and the evil and futility 
of anger and hatred.  
The realities of life are idealised by genius 
and given the form that makes drama, 
poetry or great prose. Since literature is 
closely related to life, so long as the 
human family is divided into nations, 
literature cannot escape the effects of such 
division.  
But 
the 
highest 
literature 
transcends 
regionalism and through it, when we are 
properly attuned, we realise the essential 
oneness 
of 
the 
human 
family. 
The 
Mahabharata is of this class. It belongs to 
the world and not only to India. To the 
people of India, indeed, this epic has been 
an 
unfailing 
and 
perennial 
source of 
spiritual strength. Learnt at the mother's 
knee with reverence and love, it has 
inspired great men to heroic deeds as well 
as enabled the humble to face their trials 
with fortitude and faith. 
The Mahabharata was composed many 
thousand years ago. But generations of 
gifted reciters have added to Vyasa's 
original a great mass of material. All the 
floating literature that was thought to be 
worth preserving, historical, geographical, 
legendary 
political, 
theological 
and 
philosophical, of nearly thirty centuries, 
found a place in it.   
In those days, when there was no printing, 
interpolation 
in 
a 
recognised 
classic 
seemed to correspond to inclusion in the 
national 
library. 
 
Divested 
of 
these 
accretions, the Mahabharata is a noble 
poem possessing in a supreme degree the 
characteristics of a true epic, great and 
fateful movement, heroic characters and 
stately diction. 
The characters in the epic move with the 
vitality of real life. It is difficult to find 
anywhere such vivid portraiture on so 
ample a canvas. Bhishma, the perfect 
knight; the venerable Drona; the vain but 
chivalrous 
Karna; 
Duryodhana, 
whose 
perverse pride is redeemed by great 
courage in adversity; the high souled 
Pandavas with godlike strength as well as 
power 
of 
suffering; 
Draupadi, 
most 
unfortunate of queens; Kunti, the worthy 
mother of heroes; Gandhari, the devoted 
wife and sad mother of the wicked sons of 
Dhritarashtra, these are some of the 
immortal figures on that crowded, but 
never confused, canvas.  
Then there is great Krishna himself, most 
energetic 
of 
men, 
whose 
divinity 
scintillates through a cloud of very human 
characteristics. 
His 
high 
purposefulness 
pervades the whole epic. One can read 
even a translation and feel the over 
whelming 
power 
of 
the 
incomparable 
vastness and sublimity of the poem. 
The 
Mahabharata 
discloses 
a 
rich 
civilisation and a highly evolved society, 
which though of an older world, strangely 
resembles the India of our own time, with 
the same values and ideals. India was 
divided into a number of independent 
kingdoms. 
Occasionally, 
one 
king, 
more 
distinguished or ambitious than the rest, 
would 
assume 
the 
title 
of 
emperor, 
securing 
the 
acquiescence 
of 
other 
royalties, and signalised it by a great 
sacrificial 
feast. 
The 
adherence 
was 
generally voluntary. The assumption of 
imperial title conferred no overlordship. 
The emperor was only first among his 
peers.  
The art of war was highly developed and 
military prowess and skill were held in 
high esteem. We read in the Mahabharata 
of standardised phalanxes and of various 
tactical 
movements. 
There 
was 
an 
accepted code of honorable warfare, 
deviations from which met with reproof 
among Kshatriyas. The advent of the Kali 
age is marked by many breaches of these 
conventions in the Kurukshetra battle, on 
account of the bitterness of conflict, 
frustration and bereavements. Some of the 
most impressive passages in the epic 
center round these breaches of dharma.  
The population lived in cities and villages. 
The cities were the headquarters of kings 
and their household and staff. There were 
beautiful palaces and gardens and the 
lives led were cultured and luxurious. 
There was trade in the cities, but the mass 
of the people were agriculturists. 
Besides this urban and rural life, there was 
a very highly cultured life in the seclusion 
of forest recesses, centerd round ascetic 
teachers. These ashramas kept alive the 
bright 
fires 
of 
learning 
and 
spiritual 
thought. 
Young 
men 
of 
noble 
birth 
eagerly 
sought 
education 
at 
these 
ashramas. World-weary aged went there 
for peace. These centers of culture were 
cherished by the rulers of the land and not 
the proudest of them would dare to treat 
the members of the hermitages otherwise 
than with respect and consideration. 
Women were highly honored and entered 
largely in the lives of their husbands and 
sons. The caste system prevailed, but 
intercaste marriages were not unknown. 
Some of the greatest warriors in the 
Mahabharata 
were 
brahmanas. 
 
The 
Mahabharata has moulded the character 
and civilisation of one of the most 
numerous of the world's people.  
How did it fulfil, how is it still continuing 
to fulfil, this function? By its gospel of 
dharma, which like a golden thread runs 
through all the complex movements in the 
epic. By its lesson that hatred breeds 
hatred, that covetousness and violence 
lead inevitably to ruin, that the only real 
conquest is in the battle against one's 
lower nature. 
1. GANAPATI, THE SCRIBE 
BHAGAVAN VYASA, the celebrated 
compiler of the Vedas, was the son of the 
great sage Parasara. It was he who gave to 
the 
world 
the 
divine 
epic 
of 
the 
Mahabharata.  
Having conceived the Mahabharata he 
thought of the means of giving the sacred 
story to the world. He meditated on 
Brahma, the Creator, who manifested 
himself before him. Vyasa saluted him 
with bowed head and folded hands and 
prayed: 
"Lord, I have conceived an excellent 
work, but cannot think of one who can 
take it down to my dictation." 
Brahma extolled Vyasa and said: "O sage, 
invoke Ganapati and beg him to be your 
amanuensis." Having said these words he 
disappeared. The sage Vyasa meditated on 
Ganapati who appeared before him. Vyasa 
received him with due respect and sought 
his aid. 
"Lord Ganapati, I shall dictate the story of 
the Mahabharata and I pray you to be 
graciously pleased to write it down." 
Ganapati replied: "Very well. I shall do as 
you wish. But my pen must not stop while 
I am writing. So you must dictate without 
pause or hesitation. I can only write on 
this condition?" 
Vyasa agreed, guarding himself, however, 
with a counter stipulation: "Be it so, but 
you must first grasp the meaning of what I 
dictate before you write it down." 
Ganapati 
smiled 
and 
agreed 
to 
the 
condition. Then the sage began to sing the 
story of the Mahabharata. He would 
occasionally 
compose 
some 
complex 
stanzas 
which 
would 
make 
Ganapati 
pause a while to get at the meaning and 
Vyasa would avail himself of this interval 
to compose many stanzas in his mind. 
Thus the Mahabharata came to be written 
by Ganapati to the dictation of Vyasa.  
It was before the days of printing, when 
the memory of the learned was the sole 
repository of books. Vyasa first taught the 
great epic to his son, the sage Suka. Later, 
he expounded it to many other disciples. 
Were it not so, the book might have been 
lost to future generations. 
Tradition has it that Narada told the story 
of the Mahabharata to the devas while 
Suka taught it to the Gandharvas, the 
Rakshasas and the Yakshas. It is well 
known that the virtuous and learned 
Vaisampayana, one of the chief disciples 
of Vyasa, revealed the epic for the benefit 
of humanity.  
Janamejaya, the son of the great King 
Parikshit, conducted a great sacrifice in 
the 
course 
of 
which 
Vaisampayana 
narrated the story at the request of the 
former. Afterwards, this story, as told by 
Vaisampayana, was recited by Suta in the 
forest of Naimisa to an assembly of sages 
under the lead of the Rishi Saunaka. 
Suta addressed the assembly: "I had the 
good fortune to hear the story of the 
Mahabharata composed by Vyasa to teach 
humanity dharma and the other ends of 
life. I should like to narrate it to you." At 
these words the ascetics eagerly gathered 
round him. 
Suta continued: "I heard the main story of 
the Mahabharata and the episodic tales 
contained therein told by Vaisampayana at 
the 
sacrifice 
conducted 
by 
King 
Janamejaya. 
Afterwards, 
I 
made 
an 
extensive pilgrimage to various sacred 
places and also visited the battlefield 
where the great battle described in the 
epic was fought. I have now come here to 
meet you all." He then proceeded to tell 
the whole story of the Mahabharata in the 
grand assembly. 
After the death of the great King Santanu, 
Chitrangada became King of Hastinapura 
and he was succeeded by Vichitravirya. 
The latter had two sons, Dhritarashtra and 
Pandu. The elder of the two being born 
blind, 
Pandu, 
the 
younger 
brother, 
ascended the throne. In the course of his 
reign, Pandu committed a certain offence 
and had to resort to the forest with his two 
wives where he spent many years in 
penance. 
During their stay in the forest, the two 
wives of Pandu, Kunti and Madri gave 
birth to five sons who became well known 
as the five Pandavas. Pandu passed away 
while they were still living in the forest. 
The sages brought up the five Pandavas 
during their early years.  
When Yudhishthira, the eldest, attained 
the age of sixteen the rishis led them all 
back to Hastinapura and entrusted them to 
the old grandsire Bhishma. In a short time 
the Pandavas gained mastery over the 
Vedas and the Vedanta as well as over the 
various arts, especially pertaining to the 
Kshatriyas. The Kauravas, the sons of the 
blind Dhritarashtra, became jealous of the 
Pandavas and tried to injure them in 
various ways.  
Finally Bhishma, the head of the family, 
intervened 
to 
bring 
about 
mutual 
understanding and peace between them. 
Accordingly 
the 
Pandavas 
and 
the 
Kauravas began to rule separately from 
their respective capitals, Indraprastha and 
Hastinapura.  
Some time later, there was a game of dice 
between the Kauravas and the Pandavas 
according to the then prevailing Kshatriya 
code of honor. Sakuni, who played on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Kauravas, 
defeated 
Yudhishthira. As a result, the Pandavas 
had to be in exile for a period of thirteen 
years. They left the kingdom and went to 
the 
forest 
with 
their 
devoted 
wife 
Draupadi. 
According to the conditions of the game, 
the Pandavas spent twelve years in the 
forest and the thirteenth year incognito.  
When they returned and demanded of 
Duryodhana their paternal heritage, the 
latter, who had in the meanwhile usurped 
their kingdom, refused to return it. War 
followed as a consequence.  
The Pandavas defeated Duryodhana and 
regained their patrimony. The Pandavas 
ruled the kingdom for thirty-six years. 
Afterwards, they transferred the crown to 
their grandson, Parikshit, and repaired to 
the forest with Draupadi, all clad humbly 
in barks of trees. 
This is the substance of the story of the 
Mahabharata. 
In 
this 
ancient 
and 
wonderful epic of our land there are many 
illustrative tales and sublime teachings, 
besides the narrative of the fortunes of the 
Pandavas.  
The Mahabharata is in fact a veritable 
ocean containing countless pearls and 
gems. It is, with the Ramayana, a living 
fountain of the ethics and culture of our 
Motherland. 
2. DEVAVRATA 
"You must certainly become my wife, 
whoever you may be." Thus said the great 
King Santanu to the goddess Ganga who 
stood 
before 
him 
in 
human 
form, 
intoxicating 
his 
senses 
with 
her 
superhuman loveliness. 
The king earnestly offered for her love his 
kingdom, his wealth, his all, his very life. 
Ganga replied: "O king, I shall become 
your wife. But on certain conditions that 
neither you nor anyone else should ever 
ask me who I am, or whence I come. You 
must also not stand in the way of 
whatever I do, good or bad, nor must you 
ever be wroth with me on any account 
whatsoever. You must not say anything 
displeasing to me. If you act otherwise, I 
shall leave you then and there. Do you 
agree?" 
The infatuated king vowed his assent, and 
she became his wife and lived with him. 
The heart of the king was captivated by 
her modesty and grace and the steady love 
she bore him. King Santanu and Ganga 
lived a life of perfect happiness, oblivious 
of the passage of time. 
She gave birth to many children; each 
newborn babe she took to the Ganges and 
cast into the river, and then returned to the 
king with a smiling face.  
Santanu 
was 
filled 
with 
horror 
and 
anguish at such fiendish conduct, but 
suffered it all in silence, mindful of the 
promise be had made. Often he wondered 
who she was, wherefrom she had come 
and why she acted like a murderous witch. 
Still bound by his word, and his all-
mastering love for her, he uttered no word 
of blame or remonstrance. 
Thus she killed seven children. When the 
eighth child was born and she was about 
to throw it into the Ganges, Santanu could 
not bear it any longer.  
He cried: "Stop, stop, why are you bent on 
this horrid and unnatural murder of your 
own innocent babes?" With this outburst 
the king restrained her. 
"O great king," she replied, "you have 
forgotten your promise, for your heart is 
set on your child, and you do not need me 
any more. I go. I shall not kill this child, 
but listen to my story before you judge 
me. I, who am constrained to play this 
hateful role by the curse of Vasishtha, am 
the goddess Ganga, adored of gods and 
men. Vasishtha cursed the eight Vasus to 
be born in the world of men, and moved 
by their supplications said, I was to be 
their mother. I bore them to you, and well 
is it for you that it was so. For you will go 
to higher regions for this service you have 
done to the eight Vasus. I shall bring up 
this last child of yours for some time and 
then return it to you as my gift."  
After saying these words the goddess 
disappeared with the child. It was this 
child 
who 
later 
became 
famous 
as 
Bhishma. This was how the Vasus came 
to incur Vasishtha's curse. They went for a 
holiday with their wives to a mountain 
tract 
where 
stood 
the 
hermitage 
of 
Vasishtha: One of them saw Vasishtha's 
cow, Nandini, grazing there.  
Its divinely beautiful form attracted him 
and he pointed it out to the ladies. They 
were all loud in praise of the graceful 
animal, and one of them  requested her 
husband to secure it for her. 
He replied: "What need have we, the 
devas, for the milk of cows? This cow 
belongs to the sage Vasishtha who is the 
master of the whole place. Man will 
certainly become immortal by drinking its 
milk. But this is no gain to us, who are 
already immortal. Is it worth our while 
incurring 
Vasishtha's 
wrath 
merely 
to 
satisfy a whim?" 
But she was not thus to be put off. "I have 
a dear companion in the mortal world. It is 
for her sake that I make this request. 
Before Vasishtha returns we shall have 
escaped with the cow. You must certainly 
do this for my sake, for it is my dearest 
wish." Finally her husband yielded. All 
the Vasus joined together and took the 
cow and its calf away with them.  
When Vasishtha returned to his ashrama, 
he missed the cow and the calf, because 
they were indispensable for his daily 
rituals. 
Very soon he came to know by his yogic 
insight all that had taken place. Anger 
seized him and he uttered a curse against 
the Vasus. The sage, whose sole wealth 
was his austerity, willed that they should 
be born into the world of men. When the 
Vasus came to know of the curse, 
repentant too late, they threw themselves 
on 
the 
sage's 
mercy 
and 
implored 
forgiveness. 
Vasishtha said: "The curse must needs 
take its course. Prabhasa, the Vasu who 
seized the cow, will live long in the world 
in all glory, but the others will be freed 
from the curse as soon as born. My words 
cannot prove ineffective, but I shall soften 
the curse to this extent."  
Afterwards, Vasishtha set his mind again 
on his austerities, the effect of which had 
been slightly impaired by his anger. Sages 
who perform austerities acquire the power 
to curse, but every exercise of this power 
reduces their store of merit.  
The Vasus felt relieved and approached 
the goddess Ganga and begged of her: 
"We pray you to become our mother. For 
our sake we beseech you to descend to the 
earth and marry a worthy man. Throw us 
into the water as soon as we are born and 
liberate us from the curse." The goddess 
granted their prayer, came to the earth and 
became the wife of Santanu. 
When the goddess Ganga left Santanu and 
disappeared with the eighth child, the king 
gave up all sensual pleasures and ruled the 
kingdom in a spirit of asceticism. One day 
he was wandering along the banks of the 
Ganges when he saw a boy endowed with 
the beauty and form of Devendra, the king 
of the gods.  
The child was amusing himself by casting 
a dam of arrows across the Ganges in 
flood, playing with the mighty river as a 
child with an indulgent mother. To the 
king 
who 
stood 
transfixed 
with 
amazement at the sight, the goddess 
Ganga revealed herself and presented the 
child as his own son. 
She said: "O king, this is that eighth child 
I bore you. I have brought him up till now. 
His  name is Devavrata. He has mastered 
the art of arms and equals Parasurama in 
prowess. He has learnt the Vedas and the 
Vedanta from Vasishtha, and is well 
versed in the arts and sciences known to 
Sukra. Take back with you this child who 
is a great archer and hero as well as a 
master in statecraft." 
Then she blessed the boy, handed him to 
his father, the king, and disappeared. 
3. BHISHMA'S VOW 
WITH joy the king received to his heart 
and his kingdom the resplendent and 
youthful prince Devavrata and crowned 
him as the Yuvaraja, the heir apparent. 
Four years went by. One day as the king 
was wandering on the banks of the 
Yamuna, the air was suddenly filled with 
a fragrance so divinely sweet that the king 
sought for its cause, and he traced it to a 
maiden so lovely that she seemed a 
goddess. A sage had conferred on her the 
boon 
that 
a 
divine 
perfume 
should 
emanate from her, and this was now 
pervading the whole forest. 
From the moment the goddess Ganga left 
him, the king had kept his senses under 
control, but the sight of this divinely 
beautiful 
maiden 
burst 
the 
bonds 
of 
restraint 
and 
filled 
him 
with 
an 
overmastering desire. He asked her to be 
his wife.  
The maiden said: "I am a fisherwoman, 
the daughter of the chief of the fishermen. 
May it please you to ask him and get his 
consent." Her voice was sweet as her 
form. 
The father was an astute man.  
He said: "O king, there is no doubt that 
this maiden, like every other, has to be 
married to someone and you are indeed 
worthy of her. Still you have to make a 
promise to me before you can have her." 
Santanu replied: "If it is a just promise I 
shall make it." 
The chief of the fisherfolk said: "The child 
born of this maiden should be the king 
after you."  
Though almost mad with passion, the king 
could not make this promise, as it meant 
setting aside the godlike Devavrata, the 
son of Ganga, who was entitled to the 
crown.  
It was a price that could not be thought of 
without shame. He therefore returned to 
his capital, Hastinapura, sick with baffled 
desire. He did not reveal the matter to 
anyone and languished in silence. 
One day Devavrata asked his father: "My 
father, you have all that your heart could 
wish. Why then are you so unhappy? How 
is it that you are like one pining away with 
a secret sorrow?" 
The king replied: "Dear son, what you say 
is true. I am indeed tortured with mental 
pain and anxiety. You are my only son 
and you are always preoccupied with 
military ambitions. Life in the world is 
uncertain and wars are incessant. If 
anything untoward befalls you our family 
will become extinct. Of course, you are 
equal to a hundred sons. Still, those who 
are well read in the scriptures say that in 
this transitory world having but one son is 
the same as having no son at all. It is, not 
proper that the perpetuation of our family 
should depends on a single life, and above 
all things I desire the perpetuation of our 
family. This is the cause of my anguish." 
The father prevaricated, being ashamed to 
reveal the whole story to his son.  
Thewise Devavrata realised that there 
must be a secret cause for the mental 
condition of his father, and questioning 
the king's charioteer came to know of his 
meeting with the fishermaiden on the 
banks of the Yamuna. He went to the 
chief of the fishermen and besought his 
daughter's hand on his father's behalf. 
The fisherman was respectful, but firm: 
"My daughter is indeed fit to be the king's 
spouse. Then should not her son become 
king? But you have been crowned as the 
heir apparent and will naturally succeed 
your father. It is this that stands in the 
way." 
Devavrata replied: "I give you my word 
that the son born of this maiden shall be 
king. And I renounce in his favor my right 
as heir apparent," and he took a vow to 
that effect. 
The chief of the fishermen said: "O best of 
the Bharata race, you have done what no 
one else born of royal blood has you have 
done till now. You are indeed a hero. You 
can yourself conduct my daughter to the 
king, your father. Still, hear with patience 
these words of mine which I say as the 
father of the girl. 
"I have no doubt you will keep your word, 
but how can I hope that the children born 
of you will renounce their birthright? 
Your sons will naturally be mighty heroes 
like you, and will be hard to resist if they 
seek to seize the kingdom by force. This is 
the doubt that torments me." 
When he heard this knotty question posed 
by the girl's father, Devavrata, who was 
bent on fulfilling the king's desire, made 
his supreme renunciation. He vowed with 
upraised arm to the father of the maiden: 
"I shall never marry and I dedicate myself 
to a life of unbroken chastity."  
And as he uttered these words of 
renunciation the gods showered flowers 
on his head, and cries of "Bhishma," 
"Bhishma" 
resounded 
in 
the 
air. 
"Bhishma" means one who undertakes a 
terrible vow and fulfils it. That name 
became 
the 
celebrated 
epithet 
of 
Devavrata from that time. Then the son of 
Ganga led the maiden Satyavati to his 
father. 
Two sons were born of Satyavati to 
Santanu, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya, 
who ascended the throne one after the 
other. 
Vichitravirya 
had 
two 
sons, 
Dhritarashtra 
and 
Pandu, 
born 
respectively of his two queens, Ambika 
and Ambalika.  
The sons of Dhritarashtra, a hundred in 
number, were known as the Kauravas. 
Pandu had five sons who became famous 
as the Pandavas. Bhishma lived long, 
honored by all as the grandsire until the 
end of the famous battle of Kurukshetra.

4. AMBA AND BHISHMA 
CHITRANGADA, the son of Satyavati, 
was killed in battle with a Gandharva. As 
he 
died 
childless, 
his 
brother, 
Vichitravirya, was the rightful heir and 
was duly crowned king. And as he was a 
minor, Bhishma governed the kingdom in 
his name till be came of age. 
When Vichitravirya reached adolescence 
Bhishma cast about for a bride for him. 
And as he heard that the daughters of the 
king of Kasi were to choose theirhusbands 
according 
to 
the 
ancient 
Kshatriya 
practice he went there to secure them for 
his brother.  
The rulers of Kosla, Vanga, Pundra, 
Kalinga and other princes and potentates 
had 
also 
repaired 
to 
Kasi 
for 
the 
swayamvara, attired in their best. The 
princesses were so far-famed for beauty 
and accomplishments that there was fierce 
competition to win them. 
Bhishma 
was 
famous 
among 
the 
Kshatriyas as a mighty man-at-arms. At 
first everyone thought that the redoubtable 
hero had come merely to witness the 
festivities of the swayamvara. But when 
they found that he was also a suitor, the 
young princes felt themselves let down 
and were full of chagrin. They did not 
know that he had really come for the sake 
of his brother, Vichitravirya. 
The princes began to cast affronts at 
Bhishma: "This most excellent and wise 
descendant of the Bharata race forgets that 
he is too old and forgets also his vow of 
celibacy. What has this old man to do with 
this swayamvara? 
Fie 
on 
him!" The 
princesses who were to choose their 
husbands barely glanced at the old man 
and looked away.   
Bhishma's 
wrath 
flamed 
up. 
He 
challenged the assembled princes to a trial 
of their manhood and defeated them all. 
And taking the three princesses in his 
chariot he set out for Hastinapura.  
But before he had gone far, Salva, the 
king of the Saubala country who was 
attached 
to 
Amba, 
intercepted 
and 
opposed him. For that princess had 
mentally chosen Salva as her husband. 
After a bitter fight Salva was worsted, and 
no wonder, as Bhishma was a peerless 
bowman. But at the request of the 
princesses Bhishma spared his life.  
Arriving 
in 
Hastinapura 
with 
the 
princesses, Bhishma made preparations 
for their marriage to Vichitravirya. When 
all were assembled for the marriage, 
Amba smiled mockingly at Bhishma and 
addressed him as follows: "O son of 
Ganga, you are aware of what is enjoined 
in the scriptures. I have mentally chosen 
Salva, the king of Saubala, as my 
husband. You have brought me here by 
force. Knowing this, do what you, learned 
in the scriptures, should do."  
Bhishma 
admitted 
the 
force 
of 
her 
objection and sent her to Salva with 
proper escort. The marriage of Ambika 
and Ambalika, the two younger sisters, 
with Vichitravirya was duly solemnised. 
Amba went rejoicing to Salva and told 
him what had happened: "I have mentally 
chosen you as my husband from the very 
start. Bhishma has sent me to you. Marry 
me according to the sastras."  
Salva replied: "Bhishma defeated me in 
sight of all, and carried you away. I have 
been disgraced. So, I cannot receive you 
now as my wife. Return to him and do as 
he commands." With these words Salva 
sent her back to Bhishma. 
She returned to Hastinapura and told 
Bhishma of what had taken place. The 
grandsire tried to induce Vichitravirya to 
marry 
her. 
But 
Vichitravirya 
roundly 
refused to marry a maiden whose heart 
had already been given to another. 
Amba then turned to Bhishma and she 
sought him to marry her himself as there 
was no other recourse. It was impossible 
for Bhishma to break his vow, sorry as he 
was for Amba. And after some vain 
attempts to make Vichitravirya change his 
mind, he told her there was no way left to 
her but to go again to Salva and seek to 
persuade him.  
This at first she was too proud to do, and 
for long years she abode in Hastinapura. 
Finally, in sheer desperation, she went to 
Salva and found him adamant in refusal. 
The lotus-eyed Amba spent six bitter 
years in sorrow and baffled hope. And her 
heart was seared with suffering and all the 
sweetness in her turned to gall and fierce 
hatred towards Bhishma as the cause of 
her blighted life.  
She sought in vain for a champion among 
the princes to fight and kill Bhishma and 
thus avenge her wrongs but even the 
foremost warriors were afraid of Bhishma 
and paid no heed to her appeal.  
At last, she resorted to hard austerities to 
get the grace of Lord Subrahmanya. He 
graciously appeared before her and gave 
her a garland of ever-fresh lotuses, saying 
that the wearer of that garland would 
become the enemy of Bhishma. 
Amba took the garland and again be 
sought every Kshatriya to accept the 
garland gift of the six-faced Lord and to 
champion her cause. But no one had the 
hardihood to antagonise Bhishma.  
Finally, she went to King Drupada who 
also refused to grant her prayer. She then 
hung the garland at Drupada's palace gate 
and went away to the forest. Some 
ascetics whom she met there and to whom 
she told her sorrowful tale advised her to 
go to Parasurama as a suppliant. She 
followed their advice. 
On hearing her sad story, Parasurama was 
moved with compassion and said: "Dear 
child, what do you want? I can ask Salva 
to marry you if you wish it." 
Amba said: "No, I do not wish it. I no 
longer 
desire 
marriage 
or 
home 
or 
happiness. There is now but one thing in 
life for me, revenge on Bhishma. The only 
boon I seek is the death of Bhishma." 
Parasurama moved as much by her 
anguish as by his abiding hatred of the 
Kshatriya race, espoused her cause and 
fought with Bhishma. It was a long and 
equal combat between the two greatest 
men-at-arms of the age. But in the end 
Parasurama had to acknowledge defeat. 
He told Amba: "I have done all that I 
could and I have failed. Throw yourself 
on the mercy of Bhishma. That is the only 
course left to you."  
Consumed with grief and rage, and kept 
alive only by the passion for revenge, 
Amba 
went 
to 
the 
Himalayas 
and 
practised rigorous austerities to get the 
grace of Siva, now that all human aid had 
failed her. Siva appeared before her and 
granted her a boon, that in her next birth 
she would slay Bhishma. 
Amba was impatient for that rebirth which 
would give her heart's desire. She made a 
pyre and plunged into the fire pouring out 
the flame in her heart into the scarcely 
hotter blaze of the pyre. 
By the grace of Lord Siva, Amba was 
born as the daughter of King Drupada. A 
few years after her birth, she saw the 
garland of never-fading flowers that still 
hung at the palace gate and had remained 
there untouched by anyone through fear. 
She put it round her neck. Her father 
Drupada was in consternation at her 
temerity which he feared would draw on 
his head the wrath of Bhishma. 
He sent his daughter in exile out of the 
capital 
to 
the 
forest. 
She 
practised 
austerities in the forest and in time was 
transformed into a male and became 
known as the warrior Sikhandin.  
With Sikhandin as his charioteer, Arjuna 
attacked Bhishma on the battlefield of 
Kurukshetra. 
Bhishma 
knew 
that 
Sikhandin was born as female, and true to 
his code of chivalry he would not fight 
him under any circumstance.  
So it was that Arjuna could fight screened 
by 
Sikhandin 
and 
conquer 
Bhishma, 
especially because Bhishma knew that his 
long and weary probation on earth was 
finished and consented to be vanquished.  
As the arrows struck Bhishma in his last 
fight, he singled out those which had 
pierced him deepest and said: "This is 
Arjuna's arrow and not Sikhandin's." So 
fell this great warrior.  
5. DEVAYANI AND KACHA 
IN ancient times, there was a bitter 
struggle between the devas or gods and 
the asuras or demons for the lordship of 
the three worlds. Both belligerents had 
illustrious preceptors. Brihaspati who was 
pre-eminent in the knowledge of the 
Vedas was the guiding spirit of the devas, 
while the asuras relied on Sukracharya's 
profound wisdom.  
The asuras had the formidable advantage 
that Sukracharya alone possessed the 
secret of Sanjivini which could recall the 
dead to life. Thus the asuras who had 
fallen in the battle were brought back to 
life, time and again, and continued their 
fight with the devas. The devas were thus 
at a great disadvantage in their long 
drawn-out war with their natural foes. 
They 
went 
to 
Kacha, 
the 
son 
of 
Brihaspati, and besought his aid. They 
begged him to win his way into the good 
graces of Sukracharya and persuade him 
to take him as a pupil. Once admitted to 
intimacy 
and 
confidence, 
he 
was 
to 
acquire, by fair means or foul, the secret 
of 
Sanjivini 
and 
remove 
the 
great 
handicap under which the devas suffered.  
Kacha acceded to their request and set out 
to meet Sukracharya who lived in the 
capital city of Vrishaparva, the king of the 
asuras. Kacha went to the house of Sukra, 
and after due salutation, addressed him 
thus: "I am Kacha, the grandson of the 
sage Angiras and the son of Brihaspati. I 
am a brahmacharin seeking knowledge 
under your tutelage."  
It was the law that the wise teacher should 
not refuse a worthy pupil who sought 
knowledge of him. So Sukra acceded and 
said: "Kacha, you belong to a good 
family. I accept you as my pupil, the more 
willingly, that by doing so I shall also be 
showing my respect for Brihaspati."  
Kacha 
spent 
many 
years 
under 
Sukracharya, rendering to perfection the 
prescribed duties in the household of his 
master. Sukracharya had a lovelydaughter, 
Devayani, of whom he was extremely 
fond. Kacha devoted himself to pleasing 
and serving her with song and dance and 
pastime and succeeded in winning her 
affection, without detriment however to 
the vows of brahmacharya. 
When the asuras came to know of this, 
they became anxious as they suspected 
that Kacha's object was somehow to 
wheedle out of Sukracharya the secret of 
Sanjivini. 
They 
naturally 
sought 
to 
prevent such a calamity. 
One day, as Kacha was engaged in 
grazing the cattle of his master the asuras 
seized him, tore him to pieces and cast his 
flesh to the dogs. When the cattle returned 
without Kacha, Devayani was filled with 
anxiety, and ran to her father with loud 
lamentations: "The sun has set," she 
wailed, "and your nightly fire sacrifice has 
been performed; still Kacha has not 
returned home. The cattle have come back 
by themselves. I fear some mishap has 
befallen Kacha. I cannot live without 
him." 
The fond father employed the art of 
Sanjivini and invoked the dead youth to 
appear. At once Kacha came back to life 
and greeted the master with smiles. Asked 
by Devayani the reason for his delay, he 
told her that as he was grazing the cattle 
the asuras came suddenly on him and slew 
him. How he came back to life he knew 
not, but come back to life he did, and 
there he was.  
On another occasion Kacha went to the 
forest to pluck flowers for Devayani, and 
again the asuras seized and killed him, 
and pounding his body to a paste, mixed it 
up in sea-water. As he did not return even 
after a long time Devayani went as before 
to her father who brought Kacha back to 
life by his Sanjivini, and heard from him 
all that had taken place.  
For the third time again, the Asuras killed 
Kacha and very cleverly as they thought, 
burnt his body, mixed the ashes in wine 
and served it to Sukracharya who drank it, 
suspecting nothing. Once more the cows 
returned home without their keeper, and 
once again Devayani approached her 
father with her distressful appeal for 
Kacha. 
Sukracharya tried in vain to console his 
daughter. "Though I have again and again 
brought back Kacha to life," said he, "the 
asuras seem bent upon killing him. Well, 
death is the common lot, and it is not 
proper for a wise soul like you to sorrow 
at it. Your life is all before you to enjoy, 
with youth and beauty and the goodwill of 
the world."  
Devayani deeply loved Kacha, and since 
the world began, wise words have never 
cured the ache of bereavement. She said: 
"Kacha, the grandson of Angiras and the 
son of Brihaspati, was a blameless boy, 
who was devoted and tireless in our 
service. I loved him dearly, and now that 
he has been killed, life to me has become 
bleak and insupportable. I shall therefore 
follow in his path." And Devayani began 
to fast. Sukracharya, heart-stricken by his 
daughter's sorrow, became very angry 
with the asuras, and felt that the heinous 
sin of killing a brahmana would weigh 
heavily on their fortunes.  
He employed the Sanjivini art and called 
upon Kacha to appear. By the power of 
the Sanjivini Kacha dispersed as he was in 
the wine which was inside Sukracharya's 
body at the time, regained life, but 
prevented 
by 
the 
peculiarity 
of 
his 
location from coming out, he could only 
answer to his name from where he was. 
Sukracharya 
exclaimed 
in 
angry 
amazement: "O brahmacharin, how did 
you get into me? Is this also the work of 
the asuras? This is really too bad and 
makes me feel like killing the asuras 
immediately and joining the devas. But 
tell me the whole story."  
Kacha narrated it all, in spite of the 
inconvenience imposed by his position. 
Vaisampayana 
continued: 
"The 
high-
souled 
and 
austere 
Sukracharya 
of 
immeasurable greatness, became angry at 
the deceit practised on him in his wine, 
and 
proclaimed 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
humanity: 'Virtue will desert the man who 
through lack of wisdom drinks wine. He 
will be an object of scorn to all, This is 
my message to humanity, which should be 
regarded 
as 
an 
imperative 
scriptural 
injunction.' Then he turned to his daughter 
Devayani and said: Dear daughter, here is 
a problem for you. For Kacha to live, he 
must rend my stomach and come out of it, 
and that means death to me. His life can 
only be bought by my death."  
Devayani began to weep and said: "Alas! 
It is death to me either way. For if either 
of you perish, I shall not survive." 
Sukracharya sought a way out of the 
difficulty. The real explanation of it all 
flashed on him.  
He said to Kacha: "O son of Brihaspati, I 
now see with what object you came and 
verily you have secured it! I must bring 
you out to life for the sake of Devayani, 
but equally for her sake I must not die 
either. The only way is to initiate you in 
the art of Sanjivini so that you can bring 
me back to life after I shall have died 
when a way is torn out through my 
entrails for you. You should employ the 
knowledge I am going to impart to you 
and revive me, so that Devayani need not 
grieve for either of us."  
Accordingly Sukracharya imparted the art 
of Sanjivini to Kacha. Immediately Kacha 
came forth from Sukracharya's body, 
emerging like the full moon from a cloud, 
while 
the 
great 
preceptor 
fell 
down 
mangled and dead. 
But Kacha at once brought Sukracharya 
back to life by means of his newly 
acquired Sanjivini. Kacha bowed down to 
Sukracharya and said: "The teacher who 
imparts wisdom to the ignorant is a father. 
Besides, as I have issued from your body 
you are my mother too." 
Kacha remained for many more years 
under the tutelage of Sukracharya. When 
the period of his vow ended, he took leave 
of his master to return to the world of the 
gods. 
As he was about to depart Devayani 
humbly 
addressed 
him 
thus: 
"O, 
grandchild of Angiras, you have won my 
heart by your blameless life, your great 
attainments and nobility of birth. I have 
loved you long and tenderly, even while 
you were faithfully following your vows 
of a brahmacharin. You should now 
reciprocate my love and make me happy 
by marrying me. Brihaspati as well as 
yourself are fully worthy of being honored 
by me. " 
In those days, it was no uncommon thing 
for wise and learned brahmana ladies to 
speak out their mind with honorable 
frankness. But Kacha said:  
"O faultless one, you are my master's 
daughter and ever worthy of my respect. I 
got back my life by being born out of your 
father's body. Hence I am your brother. It 
is not proper for you, my sister, to ask me 
to wed you." 
Devayani sought in vain to persuade him. 
"You are the son of Brihaspati," said she, 
"and not of my father. If I have been the 
cause of your coming back to life, it was 
because I loved you as indeed I have 
always loved you as my husband. It is not 
fit that you should give up one like me 
sinless and devoted to you." 
Kacha replied: "Do not seek to persuade 
me 
to 
unrighteousness. 
You 
are 
enchanting 
more 
so 
now 
than 
ever, 
flushed as you are with anger. But I am 
your brother. Pray bid me adieu. Serve 
unto perfection, ever and always, my 
master Sukracharya."  
With 
these 
words 
Kacha 
gently 
disengaged himself and proceeded to the 
abode of Indra, the king of gods. 
Sukracharya consoled his daughter. 
6. THE MARRIAGE OF DEVAYANI 
ONE warm afternoon, pleasantly tired 
with sporting in the woods Devayani and 
the daughters of Vrishaparva, king of the 
asuras, went to bathe in the cool waters of 
a sylvan pool, depositing their garlands on 
the bank before they entered its waters.  
A 
strong 
breeze 
blew 
their 
clothes 
together into a huddled heap and when 
they came to take them up again, some 
mistakes 
naturally 
occurred. 
It 
so 
happened that princess Sarmishtha, the 
daughter of the king, clad herself in 
Devayani's clothes. The latter was vexed 
and 
exclaimed 
half 
in 
jest 
at 
the 
impropriety of the daughter of a disciple 
wearing 
the 
clothes 
of 
the 
master's 
daughter. 
These words were spoken half in jest, but 
the 
princess 
Sarmishtha 
became 
very 
angry and said arrogantly: "Do you not 
know that your father humbly bows in 
reverence to my royal father every day? 
Are you not the daughter of a beggar who 
lives on my father's bounty? You forget I 
am of the royal race which proudly gives, 
while you come of a race which begs and 
receives, and you dare to speak thus to 
me."  
Sarmishtha went on, getting angrier and 
angrier as she spoke till, working herself 
up into a fit of anger, she finally slapped 
Devayani on the cheek and pushed her 
into a dry well. The asura maidens 
thought that Devayani had lost her life and 
returned to the palace. 
Devayani had not been killed by the fall 
into the well but was in a sad plight 
because she could not climb up the steep 
sides. Emperor Yayati of the Bharata race 
who was hunting in the forest by a happy 
chance came to this spot in search of 
water to slake his thirst. When he glanced 
into the well, he saw something bright, 
and looking closer, he was surprised to 
find a beautiful maiden lying in the well.  
He asked: "Who are you, O beautiful 
maiden with bright earrings and ruddy 
nails? Who is your father? What is your 
ancestry? How did you fall into the well?"  
She replied: "I am the daughter of 
Sukracharya. He does not know that I 
have fallen into the well. Lift me up" and 
she held forth her hands. Yayati seized her 
hand and helped her out of the well. 
Devayani did not wish to return to the 
capital of the king of the asuras. She did 
not feel it safe to go there, as she 
pondered again and again on Sarmishtha's 
conduct. She told Yayati: "You have held 
a maiden by her right hand, and you must 
marry her. I feel that you are in every way 
worthy to be my husband." 
Yayati replied: "Loving soul, I am a 
kshatriya and you are a brahmana maiden. 
How can I marry you? How can the 
daughter of Sukracharya, who is worthy to 
be the preceptor of the whole world, 
submit to be the wife of a kshatriya like 
myself? 
Revered 
lady, 
return 
home." 
Having said these words Yayati went back 
to his capital.  
A 
kshatriya 
maiden 
could 
marry 
a 
brahmana, 
according 
to 
the 
ancient 
tradition, but it was considered wrong for 
a brahmana maiden to marry a kshatriya. 
The important thing was to keep the racial 
status 
of 
women 
unlowered. 
Hence 
anuloma or the practice of marrying men 
of higher castes was legitimate and the 
reverse practice, known as pratiloma, i.e. 
marrying men of a lower caste, was 
prohibited by the sastras.  
Devayani had no mind to return home. 
She remained sunk in sorrow in the shade 
of a tree in forest. Sukracharya loved 
Devayani more than his life. After waiting 
long in vain for the return of his daughter 
who 
had 
gone 
to 
play 
with 
her 
companions, he sent a woman in search of 
her.  
The messenger after a weary search came 
on her at last near the tree where she was 
sitting in dejection, her eyes red with 
anger and grief. And she asked her what 
had happened. 
Devayani said: "Friend, go at once and tell 
my father that I will not set my foot in the 
capital of Vrishaparva" and she sent her 
back to Sukracharya.  
Extremely grieved at the sad plight of his 
daughter Sukracharya hurried to her. 
Caressing her, he said: "It is by their own 
actions, good or bad, that men are happy 
or miserable. The virtues or vices of 
others will not affect us in the least." With 
these words of wisdom, he tried to 
console her. 
She replied in sorrow and anger: "Father, 
leave alone my merits and faults, which 
are after all my own concern. But tell me 
this, was Sarmishtha, the daughter of 
Vrishaparva, right when she told me you 
were but a minstrel singing the praises of 
kings? She called me the daughter of a 
mendicant living on the doles won by 
flattery. Not content with this arrogant 
contumely, she slapped me and threw me 
into a pit which was nearby. I cannot stay 
in any place within her father's territory." 
And Devayani began to weep.  
Sukracharya drew himself up proudly: 
"Devayani," he said with dignity, "you are 
not the daughter of a court minstrel. Your 
father does not live on the wages of 
flattery. You are the daughter of one who 
is reverenced by all the world. Indra, the 
king of the gods, knows this, and 
Vrishaparva is not ignorant of his debt to 
me. But no worthy man extols his own 
merits, and I shall say no more about 
myself. Arise, you are a peerless gem 
among women, bringing prosperity to 
your family. Be patient. Let us go home."  
In this context Bhagavan Vyasa advises 
humanity 
in 
general 
in 
the 
following 
words 
of 
counsel 
addressed 
by 
Sukracharya to his daughter: 
"He conquers the world, who patiently 
puts up with the abuse of his neighbors. 
He who, controls his anger, as a horseman 
breaks an unruly horse, is indeed a 
charioteer and not he who merely holds 
the reins, but lets the horse go whither it 
would. He who sheds his anger just as a 
snake its slough, is a real hero. He who is 
not moved despite the greatest torments 
inflicted by others, will realise his aim. He 
who never gets angry is superior to the 
ritualist who faith fully performs for a 
hundred years the sacrifices ordained by 
scripture. Servants, friends, brothers, wife, 
children, virtue and truth abandon the man 
who gives way to anger. The wise will not 
take to heart the words of boys and girls."  
Devayani humbly told her father: "I am 
indeed a little girl, but, I hope, not too 
young to benefit by the great truth taught 
by you. Yet, it is not proper to live with 
persons who have no sense of decency or 
decorum. The wise will not keep company 
with those who speak ill of their family. 
However rich they may be, the ill-
mannered 
are 
really 
the 
veritable 
chandalas outside the pale of caste. The 
virtuous should not mix with them. My 
mind is ablaze with the anger roused by 
the taunts of Vrishaparva's daughter. The 
wounds inflicted by weapons may close in 
time; 
scalds may heal gradually; but 
wounds inflicted by words remain painful 
as long as one lives."  
Sukracharya went to Vrishaparva and 
fixing his eyes on him gravely said: 
"O king, though one's sins may not bring 
immediate 
punishment 
they 
are 
sure, 
sooner or later, to destroy the very germ 
of 
prosperity. 
Kacha, 
the 
son 
of 
Brihaspati, was a brahmacharin who had 
conquered his senses and never committed 
any sin. He served me with fidelity and 
never strayed from the path of virtue. 
Your attendants tried to kill him. I bore it. 
My daughter, who holds her honor high, 
had to hear dishonoring words uttered by 
your daughter. Besides, she was pushed 
into a well by your daughter. She cannot 
any more stay in your kingdom. Without 
her I cannot live here either. So, I am 
going out of your kingdom."  
At these words the king of the asuras was 
sorely troubled and said: "I am ignorant of 
the charges laid at my door. If you 
abandon me, I shall enter fire and die."  
Sukracharya replied: "I care more for the 
happiness of my daughter than for the fate 
of you and your asuras, for she is the one 
thing I have and dearer to me than life 
itself. If you can appease her, it is well 
and good. Otherwise I go."  
Vrishaparva and his retinue went to the 
tree under which Devayani stood and they 
threw 
themselves 
at 
her 
feet 
in 
supplication. 
Devayani 
was 
stubborn 
and 
said: 
"Sarmishtha who told me that I was the 
daughter of a beggar, should become my 
handmaiden and attend on me in the house 
into 
which 
my 
father 
gives 
me 
in 
marriage." 
Vrishaparva 
consented and asked his 
attendants 
to 
fetch 
his 
daughter 
Sarmishtha.  
Sarmishtha admitted her fault and bowed 
in submission. She said: "Let it be as my 
companion Devayani desires. My father 
shall not lose his preceptor for a fault 
committed by me. I will be her attendant," 
Devayani was pacified and returned to her 
house with her father. 
On another occasion also Devayani came 
across Yayati. She repeated her request 
that he should take her as his wife since he 
had clasped her right hand. Yayati again 
repeated his objection that he, a kshatriya, 
could not lawfully marry a brahmana.  
Finally they both went to Sukracharya and 
got his assent to their marriage. This is an 
instance of the pratiloma marriage which 
was resorted to on exceptional occasions. 
The sastras, no doubt, prescribe what is 
right and forbid what is wrong but a 
marriage once effected cannot be made 
invalid.  
Yayati and Devayani spent many days in 
happiness. Sarmishtha remained with her 
as an attendant. One day Sarmishtha met 
Yayati in secret and earnestly prayed to 
betaken also as his wife. He yielded to her 
prayer 
and 
married 
her 
without 
the 
knowledge of Devayani. 
But Devayani came to know of it and was 
naturally very angry, She complained to 
her father and Sukracharya in his rage 
cursed Yayati with premature old age.  
Yayati, thus suddenly stricken with age in 
the very prime of his manhood, begged so 
humbly for forgiveness that Sukracharya, 
who had not forgotten Devayani's rescue 
from the well, at last relented. 
He said: "O king, you have lost the glory 
which is youth. The curse cannot be 
recalled, but if you can persuade anyone 
to exchange his youth for your age the 
exchange 
will 
take 
effect." 
Thus 
he 
blessed Yayati and bade him farewell. 
7. YAYATI 
EMPEROR 
Yayati 
was 
one 
of 
the 
ancestors of the Pandavas. He had never 
known defeat. He followed the dictates of 
the sastras, adored the gods and venerated 
his ancestors with intense devotion. He 
became famous as a ruler devoted to the 
welfare of his subjects.  
But as has already been told, he became 
prematurely 
old 
by 
the 
curse 
of 
Sukracharya for having wronged his wife 
Devayani. In the words of the poet of the 
Mahabharata: 
"Yayati 
attained 
that 
old 
age 
which 
destroys beauty and brings on miseries." It 
is needless to describe the misery of youth 
suddenly blighted into age, where the 
horrors of loss are accentuated by pangs 
of recollection. 
Yayati, who found himself suddenly an 
old man, was still haunted by the desire 
for 
sensual 
enjoyment. 
He 
had 
five 
beautiful 
sons, 
all 
virtuous 
and 
accomplished. Yayati called them and 
appealed piteously to their affection:  
"The 
curse 
of 
your 
grandfather 
Sukracharya has made me unexpectedly 
and prematurely old. I have not had my 
fill of the joys of life. For, not knowing 
what was in store for me I lived a life of 
restraint, 
denying 
myself 
even 
lawful 
pleasures. One of you ought to bear the 
burden of my old age and give his youth 
in return. He who agrees to this and 
bestows his youth on me will be the ruler 
of my kingdom. I desire to enjoy life in 
the full vigor of youth." 
He first asked his eldest son. That son 
replied: 
"O 
great 
king, 
women 
and 
servants will mock at me if I were to take 
upon myself your old age. I cannot do go. 
Ask of my younger brothers who are 
dearer to you than myself."  
When the second son was approached, he 
gently refused with the words: "Father, 
you ask me to take up old age that 
destroys not only strength and beauty but 
also as I see wisdom. I am not strong 
enough to do so."  
The third son replied: "An old man cannot 
ride a horse or an elephant. His speech 
will falter. What can I do in such a 
helpless plight? I cannot agree." 
The king was angry and disappointed that 
his three sons had declined to do as he 
wished, but he hoped for better from his 
fourth son, to whom he said: "You should 
take up my old age. If you exchange your 
youth with me, I shall give it back to you 
after some time and take back the old age 
with which I have been cursed." 
The fourth son begged to be forgiven as 
this was a thing he could by no means 
consent to. An old man had to seek the 
help of others even to keep his body clean, 
a most pitiful plight. No, much as he 
loved his father he could not do it.  
Yayati was struck with sorrow at the 
refusal of the four sons. Still, hoping 
against hope, he supplicated his last son 
who had never yet opposed his wishes: 
"You must save me. I am afflicted with 
this old age with its wrinkles, debility and 
grey hairs as a result of the curse of 
Sukracharya. It is too hard a trial! If you 
will take upon yourself these infirmities, I 
shall enjoy life for just a while more and 
then give you back your youth and resume 
my old age and all its sorrows. Pray, do 
not refuse as your elder brothers have 
done." 
Puru, the youngest son, moved by filial 
love, said: "Father, I gladly give you my 
youth and relieve you of the sorrows of 
old age and cares of state. Be happy." 
Hearing these words Yayati embraced 
him. As soon as he touched his son, 
Yayati 
became 
a 
youth. 
Puru, 
who 
accepted the old age of his father, ruled 
the kingdom and acquired great renown. 
Yayati enjoyed life for long, and not 
satisfied, went later to the garden of 
Kubera and spent many years with an 
Apsara maiden. 
After long years spent in vain efforts to 
quench desire by indulgence, the truth 
dawned on him.  
Returning to Puru, he said: "Dear son, 
sensual desire is never quenched by 
indulgence any more than fire is by 
pouring ghee in it. I had heard and read 
this, but till now I had not realised it. No 
object of desire, corn, gold, cattle or 
women, nothing can ever satisfy the desire 
of man, We can reach peace only by a 
mental poise beyond likes and dislikes. 
Such is the state of Brahman. Take back 
your youth and rule the kingdom wisely 
and well."  
With these words Yayati took his old age. 
Puru, who regained his youth, was made 
king by Yayati who retired to the forest. 
He spent his time there in austerities and, 
in due course, attained heaven. 
8. VIDURA 
THE sage Mandavya who had acquired 
strength of mind and knowledge of the 
scriptures, spent his days in penance and 
the practice of truth.  
He lived in a hermitage in the forests on 
the outskirts of the city. One day while he 
was 
immersed 
in 
silent 
contemplation 
under the shade of a tree outside his hut of 
leaves, a band of robbers fled through the 
woods with officers of the king in hot 
pursuit.  
The 
fugitives 
entered 
the 
ashrama 
thinking that it would be a convenient 
place to hide themselves in. They placed 
their booty in a corner and hid themselves. 
The soldiers of the king came to the 
ashrama tracking their footsteps. 
The commander of the soldiers asked 
Mandavya, 
who 
was 
rapt 
in 
deep 
meditation 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
peremptory 
command: "Did you see the robbers pass 
by? Where did they go? Reply at once so 
that we may give chase and capture 
them."  
The sage, who was absorbed in yoga, 
remained silent. The commander repeated 
the question insolently.  But the sage did 
not hear anything. In the meantime some 
of the attendants entered the ashrama and 
discovered the stolen goods lying there.  
They reported this to their commander. 
All of them went in and found the stolen 
goods and the robbers who were in hiding. 
The commander thought: "Now I know 
the reason why the brahmana pretended to 
be a silent sage. He is indeed the chief of 
these 
robbers. 
He 
has 
inspired 
this 
robbery." Then he ordered his soldiers to 
guard the place, went to the king and told 
him that the sage Mandavya had been 
caught with the stolen goods.  
The king was very angry at the audacity 
of the chief of the robbers who had put on 
the garb of a brahmana sage, the better to 
deceive the world. Without pausing to 
verify the facts, he ordered the wicked 
criminal, 
as 
he 
thought 
him, 
to 
be 
impaled.  
The 
commander 
returned 
to 
the 
hermitage, impaled Mandavya on a spear 
and handed over the stolen things to the 
king.  
The virtuous sage, though impaled on the 
spear, did not die. Since he was in yoga 
when he was impaled he remained alive 
by the power of yoga. Sages who lived in 
other parts of the forest came to his 
hermitage and asked Mandavya how he 
came to be in that terrible pass.  
Mandavya replied: "Whom shall I blame? 
The servants of the king, who protect the 
world, have inflicted this punishment." 
The king was surprised and frightened 
when he heard that the impaled sage was 
still alive and that he was surrounded by 
the other sages of the forest. He hastened 
to the forest with his attendants and at 
once ordered the sage to be taken down 
from the spear. Then he prostrated at his 
feet and prayed humbly to be forgiven for 
the offence unwittingly committed. 
Mandavya was not angry with the king. 
He went straight to Dharma, the divine 
dispenser of justice, who was seated on 
his throne, and asked him: "What crime 
have I committed to deserve this torture?"  
Lord Dharma, who knew the great power 
of the sage, replied in all humility: "O 
sage, you have tortured birds and bees. 
Are you not aware that all deeds, good or 
bad, however small, inevitably produce 
their results, good or evil?" 
Mandavya was surprised at this reply of 
Lord Dharma and asked: "When did I 
commit this offence?"  
Lord Dharma replied: "When you were a 
child."  
Mandavya then pronounced a curse on 
Dharma: 
"This 
punishment 
you 
have 
decreed is far in excess of the deserts of a 
mistake 
committed 
by 
a 
child 
in 
ignorance. Be born, therefore, as a mortal 
in the world." 
Lord Dharma who was thus cursed by the 
sage Mandavya incarnated as Vidura and 
was 
born 
of 
the 
servant-maid 
of 
Ambalika, the wife of Vichitravirya. 
This story is intended to show that Vidura 
was the incarnation of Dharma. The great 
men of the world regarded Vidura as a 
mahatma who was unparalleled in his 
knowledge 
of 
dharma, 
sastras 
and 
statesmanship and was totally devoid of 
attachment and anger. Bhishma appointed 
him, while he was still in his teens, as the 
chief counsellor of king Dhritarashtra. 
Vyasa has it that no one in the three 
worlds could equal Vidura in virtue and 
knowledge. When Dhritarashtra gave his, 
permission for the game of dice, Vidura 
fell at his feet and protested solemnly: "O 
king and lord, I cannot approve of this 
action. Strife will set in among your sons 
as a result. Pray, do not allow this." 
Dhritarashtra also tried in manly ways to 
dissuade his wicked son. He said to him: 
"Do not proceed with this game. Vidura 
does not approve of it, the wise Vidura of 
lofty intellect who is ever intent on our 
welfare. He says the game is bound to 
result in a fierceness of hate which will 
consume us and our kingdom."  
But Duryodhana did not heed this advice. 
Carried away by his doting fondness for 
his son, Dhritarashtra surrendered his 
better judgment and sent to Yudhishthira 
the fateful invitation to the game. 
9. KUNTI DEVI 
SURA, the grandfather of Sri Krishna, 
was a worthy scion of the Yadava race. 
His daughter Pritha was noted for her 
beauty and virtues. Since his cousin 
Kuntibhoja was childless, Sura gave his 
daughter Pritha in adoption to him. From 
that time she was known by the name of 
Kunti after her adoptive father. 
When Kunti was a little girl, the sage 
Durvasa stayed for a time as a guest in her 
father's house and she served the sage for 
a 
year 
with 
all 
care, 
patience 
and 
devotion. He was so pleased with her that 
he gave her a divine mantra. He said: 
"If you call upon any god repeating this 
mantra, he will manifest himself to you 
and bless you with a son equal to him in 
glory." He granted her this boon because 
he foresaw by his yogic power the 
misfortune that was in store for her future 
husband.  
The impatient curiosity of youth made 
Kunti test then and there the efficacy of 
the mantra by repeating it and invoking 
the Sun whom she saw shining in the 
heavens. At once the sky grew dark with 
clouds, and under cover of them the Sun 
god approached the beautiful princess 
Kunti and stood gazing at her with ardent 
soul 
scorching 
admiration. 
Kunti, 
overpowered by the glorious vision of her 
divine visitor, asked: "O god, who art 
thou?"  
The Sun replied: "Dear maiden, I am the 
Sun. I have been drawn to you by the spell 
of the son-giving mantra that you have 
uttered."  
Kunti was aghast and said: "I am an 
unwedded girl dependent on my father. I 
am not fit for motherhood and do not 
desire it. I merely wished to test the power 
of the boon granted by the sage Durvasa. 
Go back and forgive this childish folly of 
mine." But the Sun god could not thus 
return because the power of the mantra 
held him. She for her part was mortally 
afraid of being blamed by the world. The 
Sun god however reassured her: 
"No blame shall attach to you. After 
bearing my son, you will regain virginity.'' 
Kunti conceived by the grace of the Sun, 
the giver of light and life to all the world. 
Divine 
births 
take 
place 
immediately 
without the nine months weary course of 
mortal gestation.  
She gave birth to Karna who was born 
with divine armor and earrings and was 
bright and beautiful like the Sun. In time, 
he became one of the world's greatest 
heroes. After the birth of the child, Kunti 
once again became a virgin as a result of 
the boon granted by the Sun.  
She wondered what she should do with 
the child. To hide her fault she placed the 
child in a sealed box and set it afloat in a 
river. A childless charioteer happened to 
see the floating case, and taking it, was 
surprised and delighted to see within it a 
gorgeously beautiful child. 
He handed it over to his wife who 
lavished a mother's love on it. Thus 
Karna, the son of the Sun god, came to be 
brought up as a charioteer's child. When 
the 
time 
came 
for 
giving 
Kunti 
in 
marriage, 
Kuntibhoja 
invited 
all 
the 
neighboring 
princes 
and 
held 
a 
swayamvara 
for 
her 
to 
choose 
her 
husband.  
Many 
eager 
suitors 
flocked 
to 
the 
swayamvara as the princess was widely 
famed for her great beauty and virtue. 
Kunti placed the garland on the neck of 
King Pandu, the bright representative of 
the 
Bharata 
race, 
whose 
personality 
eclipsed the lustre of all the other princes 
assembled there. The marriage was duly 
solemnised and she accompanied her 
husband to his capital Hastinapur. 
On 
the 
advice 
of 
Bhishma 
and 
in 
accordance with the prevailing custom, 
Pandu took a second wife Madri, the sister 
of the king of Madra. In the old days the 
kings took two or three wives for making 
sure of progeny and not for mere sensual 
desire. 
10. DEATH OF PANDU 
ONE day King Pandu was out hunting. A 
sage and his wife were also sporting in the 
forest in the guise of deer. Pandu shot the 
male with an arrow, in ignorance of the 
fact that it was a sage in disguise. Stricken 
to death the rishi thus cursed Pandu: 
"Sinner, you will meet with death the 
moment you taste the pleasures of the 
bed."  
Pandu was heartbroken at this curse and 
retreated to the forest with his wives after 
entrusting his kingdom to Bhishma and 
Vidura and lived there a life of perfect 
abstinence.  
Seeing 
that 
Pandu 
was 
desirous 
of 
offspring, which the rishi’s curse had 
denied him, Kunti confided to him the 
story of the mantra she had received from 
Durvasa. He urged Kunti and Madri to use 
the mantra and thus it was that the five 
Pandavas were born of the gods to Kunti 
and Madri.  
They were born and brought up in the 
forest among ascetics. King Pandu lived 
for many years in the forest with his wives 
and children. It was springtime. And one 
day Pandu and Madri forgot their sorrows 
in the rapture of sympathy with the 
throbbing life around them, the happy 
flowers, 
creepers, 
birds 
and 
other 
creatures of the forest.  
In spite of Madri’s earnest and repeated 
protests Pandu’s resolution broke down 
under the exhilarating influence of the 
season, and at once the curse of the sage 
took effect and Pandu fell, dead. 
Madri could not contain her sorrow. Since 
she felt that she was responsible for the 
death of the king. She burnt herself on the 
pyre of her husband entreating Kunti to 
remain and be a mother to her doubly 
orphaned children. 
The sages of the forest took the bereaved 
and grief-stricken Kunti and the Pandavas 
to Hastinapura and entrusted them to 
Bhishma. 
Yudhishthira was but sixteen years old at 
that time. When the sages came to 
Hastinapura and reported the death of 
Pandu in the forest, the whole kingdom 
was plunged in sorrow. Vidura, Bhishma, 
Vyasa, Dhritarashtra and others performed 
the funeral rites.  
All the people in the kingdom lamented as 
at a personal loss. Vyasa said to Satyavati, 
the grandmother: "The past has gone by 
pleasantly, 
but 
the 
future 
has 
many 
sorrows in store. The world has passed its 
youth like a happy dream and it is now 
entering on disillusionment, sin, sorrow 
and suffering. Time is inexorable. You 
need not wait to see the miseries and 
misfortunes that will befall this race. It 
will be good for you to leave the city and 
spend the rest of your days in a hermitage 
in the forest." Satyavati agreed and went 
to the forest with Ambika and Ambalika. 
These three aged queens passed through 
holy asceticism to the higher regions of 
bliss and spared themselves the sorrows of 
their children. 
11. BHIMA 
THE five sons of Pandu and the hundred 
sons of Dhritarashtra grew up in mirth and 
merriment at Hastinapura. Bhima excelled 
them all in physical prowess. He used to 
bully Duryodhana and the other Kauravas 
by dragging them by the hair and beating 
them.  
A great swimmer, he would dive, into 
pools, with one or more of them clasped 
helpless in his arms, and remain under 
water till they were almost drowned. 
Whenever they climbed up on a tree he 
would stand on the ground and kick at the 
tree and shake them down like ripe fruits.  
The bodies of the sons of Dhritarashtra 
would be ever sore with bruises as a result 
of Bhima's practical jokes. Small wonder 
that the sons of Dhritarashtra nursed a 
deep hatred for Bhima from their very 
infancy. 
As the princes grew up. Kripacharya 
taught them archery and the practice of 
arms and other things that princes should 
learn. 
Duryodhana's 
jealousy 
towards 
Bhima warped his mind and made him 
commit many improper acts. 
Duryodhana was very much worried. His 
father being blind, the kingdom was ruled 
by Pandu. After his death Yudhishthira, 
the heir-apparent, would in course of time 
become king. Duryodhana thought that as 
his blind father was quite helpless he 
must, to prevent Yudhishthira's accession 
to the throne, contrive a way of killing 
Bhima.  
He made arrangements to carry out his 
resolve since he thought that the powers 
of the Pandavas would decline with the 
death of Bhima.  
Duryodhana and his brothers planned to 
throw Bhima into the Ganges, imprison 
Arjuna and Yudhishthira, and then seize 
the kingdom and rule it. So Duryodhana 
went with his brothers and the Pandavas 
for a swim in the Ganges.  
After the sports they slept in their tents 
being 
exhausted. 
Bhima 
had 
exerted 
himself more than the others and as his 
food had been poisoned, he felt drowsy 
and lay down on the bank of the river. 
Duryodhana 
bound 
him 
with 
wild 
creepers and threw him into the river.  
The evil Duryodhana had already caused 
sharp spikes to be planted on the spot. 
This was done purposely so that Bhima 
might in falling be impaled on the spikes, 
and lose his life. Fortunately there was no 
spike in the place where Bhima fell. 
Poisonous water-snakes bit his body.  
The poisonous food he had taken was 
counteracted by the snake poison and 
Bhima came to no harm, and presently, 
the river washed him to a bank.  
Duryodhana 
thought 
that 
Bhima 
must 
have died as he had been thrown in the 
river infested with poisonous snakes and 
planted with spikes. So he returned to the 
city with the rest of the party in great joy. 
When Yudhishthira inquired about the 
whereabouts 
of 
Bhima, 
Duryodhana 
informed him that he had preceded them 
to the city. 
Yudhishthira believed Duryodhana and as 
soon as he returned home, asked his 
mother 
whether 
Bhima 
had 
returned 
home.  
His anxious question brought forth the 
reply that Bhima had not yet returned, 
which made Yudhishthira suspect some 
foul play against his brother. And he went 
again with his brothers to the forest and 
searched everywhere. But Bhima could 
not be found. They went back in great 
sorrow. 
Sometime later Bhima awoke and trudged 
wearily 
back 
home. 
Kunti 
and 
Yudhishthira 
welcomed 
him 
and 
embraced him in great joy. By the poison 
that had entered his system Bhima became 
stronger than before. 
Kunti sent for Vidura and told him in 
secret: 
"Duryodhana is wicked and cruel. He 
seeks to kill Bhima since he wants to rule 
the kingdom. I am worried." 
Vidura replied: "What you say is true, but 
keep your thoughts to yourself. For if the 
wicked Duryodhana is accused or blamed, 
his anger and hatred will only increase. 
Your sons are blessed with long life. You 
need have no fear on that account." 
Yudhishthira also warned Bhima and said: 
"Be silent over the matter. Hereafter, we 
have to be careful and help one another 
and protect ourselves." 
Duryodhana was surprised to see Bhima 
come back alive. His jealousy and hatred 
increased. He heaved a deep sigh and 
pined away in sorrow. 
12. KARNA 
THE Pandavas and the Kauravas learnt 
the 
practice 
of 
arms 
first 
 
from 
Kripacharya and later from Drona. A day 
was fixed for a test and exhibition of their 
proficiency in the use of arms in the 
presence of the royal family and as the 
public had also been invited to witness the 
performance of their beloved princes. 
There was a large and enthusiastic crowd.  
Arjuna displayed superhuman skill with 
his weapons and the vast assemblage was 
lost 
in 
wonder 
and 
admiration. 
Duryodhana's brow was dark with envy 
and hate. 
At the close of the day, there came 
suddenly from the entrance of the arena a 
sound, loud and compelling like thunder 
the sound made by the slapping of mighty 
arms in challenge. All eyes turned in that 
direction. They saw enter through the 
crowd, which made way in awed silence, 
a godlike youth from whom light and 
power seemed to emanate. He looked 
proudly round him, cast a negligent salute 
to Drona and Kripa, and strode up to 
Arjuna. The brothers, all unaware, by the 
bitter irony of fate, of their common 
blood, faced one another; for it was 
Karna. 
Karna addressed Arjuna in a voice deep as 
rumbling thunder: "Arjuna, I shall show 
greater skill than you have displayed." 
With Drona's leave, Karna the lover of 
battle, then and there duplicated all of 
Arjuna's feats with careless ease. Great 
was Duryodhana's exultation. He threw 
his 
arms 
round 
Karna 
and 
said: 
"Welcome, O thou with mighty arms, 
whom good fortune has sent to us. I and 
this kingdom of the Kurus are at your 
command."  
Said Karna: "I, Karna, am grateful, O 
king. Only two things I seek, your love 
and single combat with Partha." 
Duryodhana clasped Karna again to his 
bosom and said: "My prosperity is all 
thine to enjoy."  
As love flooded Duryodhana's heart, even 
so did blazing wrath fill Arjuna, who felt 
affronted. And glaring fiercely at Karna 
who stood, stately as a mountain peak, 
receiving the greetings of the Kaurava 
brothers, he said: "O Karna, slain by me 
thou 
shalt 
presently 
go 
to 
the 
hell 
appointed for those who intrude uninvited 
and prate unbidden." 
Karna laughed in scorn: "This arena is 
open to all, O Arjuna, and not to you 
alone. Might is the sanction of sovereignty 
and the law is based on it. But what is the 
use of mere talk which is the weapon of 
the weak? Shoot arrows instead of words."  
Thus challenged, Arjuna, with Drona's 
permission, hastily embraced his brothers 
and stood ready for combat. While Karna, 
taking 
leave 
of 
the 
Kuru 
brothers, 
confronted him weapon in hand. 
And, as though the divine parents of the 
heroes sought to encourage their offspring 
and witness this fateful battle, Indra, the 
lord of the thunderclouds, and Bhaskara of 
the in finite rays, simultaneously appeared 
in the heavens.  
When she saw Karna, Kunti knew him as 
her first born and fainted away. Vidura 
instructed the maidservant to attend upon 
her and she revived. She stood stupefied 
with anguish not knowing what to do. 
As they were about to join in battle, 
Kripa, well-versed in the rules of single 
combat, 
stepped 
between 
them 
and 
addressed Karna: 
"This prince, who is ready to fight with 
thee, is the son of Pritha and Pandu and a 
scion of the Kuru race. Reveal O mighty 
armed thy parentage and the race rendered 
illustrious by thy birth. It is only after 
knowing thy lineage that Partha can fight 
with thee, for high-born princes cannot 
engage in single combat with unknown 
adventurers." 
When he heard these words, Karna bent 
down his head like a lotus under the 
weight of rainwater. 
Duryodhana stood up and said: "If the 
combat cannot take place merely because 
Karna is not a prince, why, that is easily 
remedied. I crown Karna as the king of 
Anga." He then obtained the assent of 
Bhishma and Dhritarashtra, performed all 
the necessary rites and invested Karna 
with the sovereignty of the kingdom of 
Anga giving him the crown, jewels and 
other royal insignia. 
At that moment, as the combat between 
the youthful heroes seemed about to 
commence, the old charioteer Adhiratha, 
who was the foster-father of Karna, 
entered the assembly, staff in hand and 
quaking with fear.  
No sooner did he see him, that Karna, the 
newly crowned king of Anga, bowed his 
head and did humble obeisance in all filial 
reverence. The old man called him son, 
embraced him with his thin and trembling 
arms, and wept with joy wetting with tears 
of love his head already moistened by the 
water of the coronation. 
At this sight, Bhima roared with laughter 
and said: "O he is after all only the son of 
a charioteer! Take up the driving whip 
then as befits thy parentage. Thou art not 
worthy of death at the hands of Arjuna. 
Nor shouldst thou reign in Anga as a 
king."  
At this outrageous speech, Karna's lips 
trembled with anguish and he speechlessly 
looked up at the setting sun with a deep 
sigh. 
But Duryodhana broke in indignantly:  
"It is unworthy of you, O Vrikodara, to 
speak thus. Valor is the hallmark of a 
kshatriya. Nor is there much sense in 
tracing great heroes and mighty rivers to 
their sources. I could give you hundreds 
of instances of great men of humble birth 
and I know awkward questions might be 
asked of your own origin. Look at this 
warrior, his godlike form and bearing, his 
armor and earrings, and his skill with 
weapons. Surely there is some mystery 
about him. For how could a tiger be born 
of an antelope? Unworthy of being king of 
Anga, didst thou say? I verily hold him 
worthy to rule the whole world." 
In 
generous 
wrath, 
Duryodhana 
took 
Karna in his chariot and drove away. 
The sun set and the crowd dispersed in 
tumult. There were groups loud in talk 
under the light of the lamps, some 
glorifying 
Arjuna, 
others 
Karna, 
and 
others again Duryodhana according to 
their predilection. 
Indra foresaw that a supreme contest was 
inevitable between his son Arjuna and 
Karna. And he put on the garb of a 
brahmana and came to Karna, who was 
reputed for his charity and begged of him 
his earrings and armor. The Sun god had 
already warned Karna in a dream that 
Indra would try to deceive him in this 
manner.  
Still, Karna could not bring himself to 
refuse any gift that was asked of him. 
Hence he cut off the earrings and armor 
with which he was born and gave them to 
the brahmana. 
Indra, the king of gods, was filled with 
surprise and joy. After accepting the gift, 
he praised Karna as having done what no 
one else would do, and, shamed into 
generosity, bade Karna ask for any boon 
he wanted.  
Karna replied: "I desire to get your 
weapon, the Sakti, which has the power to 
kill enemies." Indra granted the boon, but 
with a fateful proviso. He said: "You can 
use this weapon against but one enemy, 
and it will kill him whosoever he may be. 
But this killing done, this weapon will no 
longer be available to you but will return 
to 
me." 
With 
these 
words 
Indra 
disappeared. 
Karna went to Parasurama and became his 
disciple by representing to him that he 
was a brahmana. He learnt of Parasurama 
the mantra for using the master weapon 
known as Brahmastra.  
One day Parasurama was reclining with 
the head on Karna's lap when a stinging 
worm burrowed into Karna's thigh. Blood 
began to flow and the pain was terrible. 
But Karna bore it without tremor lest he 
should 
disturb 
the 
master's 
sleep. 
Parasurama awoke and saw the blood that 
had poured from the wound.  
He said: "Dear pupil, you are not a 
brahmana. A kshatriya alone can remain 
unmoved under all bodily torments. Tell 
me the truth." 
Karna confessed that he had told a lie in 
presenting himself as a brahmana and that 
he was in fact the son of a charioteer. 
Parasurama in his anger pronounced this 
curse on him: "Since you deceived your 
guru, the Brahmastra you have learnt shall 
fail you at the fated moment. You will be 
unable to recall the invocatory mantra 
when your hour comes." 
It was because of this curse that at the 
crisis of his last fight with Arjuna, Karna 
was not able to recall the Brahmastra 
spell, though he had remembered it till 
then. Karna was the faithful friend of 
Duryodhana and remained loyally with 
the Kauravas until the end. 
After the fall of Bhishma and Drona, 
Karna became the leader of the Kaurava 
army and fought brilliantly for two days. 
In the end, the wheel of his chariot stuck 
in the ground and be was not able to lift it 
free and drive the chariot along. While he 
was in this predicament, Arjuna killed 
him. Kunti was sunk in sorrow, all the 
more poignant because she had, at that 
time, to conceal it. 
13. DRONA 
DRONA, the son of a brahmana named 
Bharadwaja, after completing his study of 
the Vedas and the Vedangas, devoted 
himself to the art of archery and became a 
great master.  
Drupada, the son of the king of Panchala, 
who was a friend of Bharadwaja, was a 
fellow-student of Drona in the hermitage 
and there grew up between them the 
generous intimacy of youth.  
Drupada, in his boyish enthusiasm, used 
often to tell Drona that he would give him 
half his kingdom when he ascended the 
throne. 
After 
completing 
his 
studies, 
Drona married the sister of Kripa, and a 
son Aswatthama was born to them.  
Drona was passionately attached to his 
wife and son, and, for their sake, desired 
to acquire wealth, a thing that he had 
never cared for before. Learning that 
Parasurama was distributing his riches 
among the brahmanas, he first went to 
him. But he was too late as Parasurama 
had already given away all his wealth and 
was about to retire to the forest.  
But, anxious to do something for Drona, 
Parasurama offered to teach him the use 
of weapons, of which he was supreme 
master.  
Drona joyfully agreed, and great archer as 
he already was, he became unrivalled 
master of the military art, worthy of eager 
welcome as preceptor in any princely 
house in that warlike age. 
Meanwhile, Drupada had ascended the 
throne of Panchala on the death of his 
father. Remembering their early intimacy 
and Drupada's expressions of readiness to 
serve him, even to the extent of sharing 
his kingdom, Drona went to him in the 
confident 
hope 
of 
being 
treated 
generously. 
But he found the king very different from 
the student. When he introduced himself 
as an old friend, Drupada, far from being 
glad to see him, felt it an intolerable 
presumption.  
Drunk with power and wealth, Drupada 
said: "O brahmana, how dare you address 
me 
familiarly 
as 
your 
friend? 
What 
friendship can there be between a throned 
king and a wandering beggar? What a fool 
must you be to presume on some long past 
acquaintance to claim friend ship with a 
king who rules a kingdom? How can a 
pauper be the friend of a wealthy man, or 
an ignorant boor of a learned scholar, or a 
coward of a hero? Friendship can exist 
only between equals. A vagrant beggar 
cannot be the friend of a sovereign." 
Drona was turned out of the palace with 
scorn in his ears and a blazing wrath in his 
heart. 
He made a mental vow to punish the 
arrogant king for this insult and his 
repudiation of the sacred claims of early 
friendship. His next move in search of 
employment was to go to Hastinapura, 
where he spent a few days, in retirement, 
in 
the 
house 
of 
his 
brother-in-law 
Kripacharya.  
One day, the princes were playing with a 
ball outside the precincts of the city, and 
in the course of the game, the ball as well 
as Yudhishthira's ring fell into a well. The 
princes had gathered round the well and 
saw the ring shining from the bottom 
through the clear water. But could see no 
way of getting it out. They did not 
however, notice that a brahmana of dark 
complexion stood nearby watching them 
with a smile.  
"Princes," he surprised them by saying, 
"you are the descendants of the heroic 
Bharata race. Why cannot you take out the 
ball as anyone skilled in arms should 
know how to do? Shall I do it for you?" 
Yudhishthira laughed and said in fun: "O 
brahmana, if you take out the ball, we will 
see that you have a good meal in the 
house of Kripacharya." Then Drona the 
brahmana stranger, took a blade of grass 
and sent it forth into the well after reciting 
certain words of power for propelling it as 
an arrow.  
The blade of grass straightway sped and 
stuck into the ball. Afterwards he sent a 
number of similar blades in succession 
which clinging together formed a chain, 
wherewith Drona took out the ball. 
The princes were lost in amazement and 
delight and begged of him to get the ring 
also. Drona borrowed a bow, fixed an 
arrow on the string and sent it right into 
the ring. The arrow rebounding brought 
up the ring and the brahmana handed it to 
the prince with a smile.  
Seeing these feats, the princes were 
astonished and said: "We salute you, O 
brahmana. Who are you? Is there anything 
we can do for you?" and they bowed to 
him. 
He said: "O princes, go to Bhishma and 
learn from him who I am." 
From the description given by the princes, 
Bhishma knew that the brahmana was 
none other than the famous master Drona. 
He decided that Drona was the fittest 
person to impart further instruction to the 
Pandavas and the Kauravas. So, Bhishma 
received him with special honor and 
employed him to instruct the princes in 
the use of arms.  
As soon as the Kauravas and the Pandavas 
had acquired mastery in the science of 
arms, Drona sent Karna and Duryodhana 
to seize Drupada and bring him alive, in 
discharge of the duty they owed to him as 
their master.  
They went as ordered by him, but could 
not accomplish their task. Then the master 
sent forth Arjuna on the same errand. He 
defeated Drupada in battle and brought 
him and his minister captives to Drona. 
Then Drona smilingly addressed Drupada: 
"Great king, do not fear for your life. In 
our boyhood we were companions but you 
were pleased to forget it and dishonor me. 
You told me that a king alone could be 
friend to a king. Now I am a king, having 
conquered your kingdom. Still I seek to 
regain my friendship with you, and so I 
give you half of your kingdom that has 
become mine by conquest. Your creed is 
that friendship is possible only between 
equals. And we shall now be equals, each 
owning a half of your kingdom."  
Drona thought this sufficient revenge for 
the insult he had suffered, set Drupada at 
liberty 
and 
treated 
him 
with 
honor. 
Drupada's pride was thus humbled but, 
since 
hate 
is 
never 
extinguished 
by 
retaliation, and few things are harder to 
bear than the pangs of wounded vanity, 
hatred of Drona and a wish to be revenged 
on him became the ruling passion of 
Drupada's life.  
The king performed tapas, underwent 
fasts and conducted sacrifices in order to 
win the gratified gods to bless him with a 
son who should slay Drona and a daughter 
who should wed Arjuna.  
His efforts were crowned with success 
with the birth of Dhrishtadyumna who 
commanded 
the 
Pandava 
army 
at 
Kurukshetra and, helped by a strange 
combination of circumstances, slew the 
otherwise unconquerable Drona, and birth 
of Draupadi, the consort of the Pandavas.  
14. THE WAX PALACE 
THE jealousy of Duryodhana began to 
grow at the sight of the physical strength 
of Bhima and the dexterity of Arjuna. 
Karna and Sakuni became Duryodhana's 
evil 
counsellors 
in 
planning 
wily 
stratagems.  
As for poor Dhritarashtra, he was a wise 
man no doubt and he also loved his 
brother's sons, but he was weak of will 
and dotingly attached to his own children. 
For his children's sake the worse became 
the better reason, and he would sometimes 
even knowingly follow the wrong path.  
Duryodhana sought in various ways to kill 
the Pandavas. It was by means of the 
secret help rendered by Vidura who 
wanted to save the family from a great sin, 
that the Pandavas escaped with their lives. 
One unforgivable offence of the Pandavas 
in the eyes of Duryodhana was that the 
people of the city used to praise them 
openly and declare in season and out of 
season that Yudhishthira alone was fit to 
be the king.  
They would flock together and argue: 
"Dhritarashtra could never be king for he 
was born blind. It is not proper that he 
should now hold the kingdom in his 
hands. Bhishma cannot be king either, 
because he is devoted to truth and to his 
vow that he would not be a king. Hence 
Yudhishthira alone should be crowned as 
king. He alone can rule the Kuru race and 
the kingdom with justice." Thus people 
talked everywhere. These words were 
poison to Duryodhana's ears, and made 
him writhe and burn with jealousy.  
He went to Dhritarashtra and complained 
bitterly of the public talk: "Father, the 
citizens babble irrelevant nonsense. They 
have no respect even for such venerable 
persons as Bhishma and yourself. They 
say 
that 
Yudhishthira 
should 
be 
immediately crowned king. This would 
bring disaster on us. You were set aside 
because of your blindness, and your 
brother became the king. If Yudhishthira 
is to succeed his father, where do we 
come? What chance has our progeny? 
After Yudhishthira his son, and his son's 
son, and then his son will be the kings. 
We will sink into poor relations dependent 
on them even for our food. To live in hell 
would be better than that!"  
At these words, Dhritarashtra began to 
ponder and said: "Son, what you say is 
true. Still Yudhishthira will not stray from 
the path of virtue. He loves all. He has 
truly inherited all the excellent virtues of 
his deceased father. People praise him and 
will support him, and all the ministers of 
the State and commanders of armies, to 
whom Pandu had endeared himself by his 
nobility of character, will surely espouse 
his cause. As for the people, they idolise 
the Pandavas. We cannot oppose them 
with any chance of success. If we do 
injustice, 
the 
citizens 
will 
rise 
in 
insurrection and either kill us or expel us. 
We 
shall 
only 
cover 
ourselves 
with 
ignominy."  
Duryodhana 
replied: 
"Your 
fears 
are 
baseless. Bhishma will at worst be neutral, 
while Ashwatthama is devoted to me, 
which means that his father Drona and 
uncle Kripa will also be on our side. 
Vidura cannot openly oppose us, if for no 
other reason, because he has not the 
strength. Send the Pandavas immediately 
to Varanavata. I tell you the solemn truth 
that my cup of suffering is full and I can 
bear no more. It pierces my heart and 
renders me sleepless and makes my life a 
torment. After sending the Pandavas to 
Varanavata we shall try to strengthen our 
party."  
Later, some politicians were prevailed 
upon to join Duryodhana's party and 
advise the king in the matter. Kanika, the 
minister of Sakuni, was their leader. "O 
king," he said, "guard yourselves against 
the sons of Pandu, for their goodness and 
influence are a menace to you and yours. 
The Pandavas are the sons of your 
brother, but the nearer the kin, the closer 
and deadlier the danger. They are very 
strong."  
Sakuni's 
minister 
continued: 
"Be 
not 
wroth with me if I say a king should be 
mighty in action as in name, for nobody 
will believe in strength which is never 
displayed. State affairs should be kept 
secret and the earliest indication to the 
public, of a wise plan, should be its 
execution. Also, evils must be eradicated 
promptly for a thorn which has been 
allowed to remain in the body may cause 
a 
festering 
wound. 
Powerful 
enemies 
should be destroyed and even a weak foe 
should not be neglected since a mere 
spark, if over looked, may cause a forest 
fire. A strong enemy should be destroyed 
by means of stratagem and it would be 
folly to show mercy to him. O king, guard 
yourself against the sons of Pandu. They 
are very powerful." 
Duryodhana 
told 
Dhritarashtra 
of 
his 
success in securing adherents: "I have 
bought 
the 
goodwill 
of 
the 
king's 
attendants with gifts of wealth and honor. 
I have won over his ministers to our 
cause. If you will adroitly prevail upon the 
Pandavas to go to Varanavata, the city and 
the whole kingdom will take our side. 
They will not have a friend left here. Once 
the kingdom has become ours, there will 
be no power for harm left in them, and it 
may even be possible to let them come 
back." 
When many began to say what he himself 
wished to believe, Dhritarashtra's mind 
was shaken and he yielded to his sons' 
counsels. It only remained to give effect 
to the plot.  
The ministers began to praise the beauty 
of Varanavata in the hearing of the 
Pandavas and made mention of the fact 
that a great festival in honor of Siva 
would be conducted there with all pomp 
and splendor.  
The unsuspecting Pandavas were easily 
persuaded, especially when Dhritarashtra 
also told them in tones of great affection 
that they should certainly go and witness 
the festivities, not only because they were 
worth seeing but because the people of the 
place were eager to welcome them.  
The Pandavas took leave of Bhishma and 
other elders and went to Varanavata. 
Duryodhana was elated. He plotted with 
Karna and Sakuni to kill Kunti and her 
sons 
at 
Varanavata. 
They 
sent 
for 
Purochana, a minister, and gave him 
secret 
instructions 
which 
he 
bound 
himself to carry out faithfully.  
Before 
the 
Pandavas 
proceeded 
to 
Varanavata, 
Purochana, 
true 
to 
his 
instructions, hastened to the spot well in 
advance and had a beautiful palace built 
for their reception. Combustible materials 
like jute, lac, ghee, oil, and fat were used 
in the construction of the palace. The 
materials for the plastering of the walls 
were also inflammable. He skilfully filled 
up various parts of the building with dry 
things that could catch fire easily, and had 
inviting seats and bedsteads disposed at 
the most combustible places.  
Every convenience was furnished for the 
Pandavas to dwell in the city without fear, 
until the palace was built. When the 
Pandavas had settled down in the wax 
house, the idea was to set fire to it at night 
when they were sound asleep.  
The ostentatious love and solicitude with 
which the Pandavas had been received 
and treated would obviate all suspicion 
and the fire would be taken as a sad case 
of pure accident. No one would dream of 
blaming the Kauravas. 
15. THE ESCAPE OF THE 
PANDAVAS 
AFTER taking reverential leave of the 
elders and embracing their comrades, the 
Pandavas proceeded to Varanavata. The 
citizens accompanied them a part of their 
way and returned unwillingly to the city. 
Vidura pointedly warned Yudhishthira in 
words intelligible only to the prince: 
"He alone will escape from danger who 
forestalls 
the 
intentions 
of 
an 
astute 
enemy. There are weapons sharper than 
those made of steel. And the wise man 
who would escape destruction must know 
the means to guard against them. The 
conflagration 
that 
devastates 
a 
forest 
cannot hurt a rat which shelters itself in a 
hole or a porcupine which burrows in the 
earth. The wise man knows his bearings 
by looking at the stars."  
Though they had started on their journey 
in sunshine of joy, they now proceeded in 
a dark cloud of sorrow and anxiety.  
The people of Varanavata were very 
happy to learn of the coming of the 
Pandavas to their city and welcomed 
them. After a brief stay in other houses 
while the palace specially meant for them 
was being got ready, they moved into it 
under Purochana's guidance.  
It was named "Sivam" which means 
prosperity, and that was the name which, 
in 
ghastly 
irony, 
was 
given 
to 
the 
deathtrap. 
Yudhishthira 
diligently 
examined the whole place bearing in mind 
Vidura's warning and verified that the 
building was without a shadow of doubt 
constructed with combustible material.  
Yudhishthira told Bhima: "Though we 
know very well that the palace is a trap of 
death, we should not make Purochana 
suspect that we know his plot. We should 
get away at the right moment but escape 
would be difficult if we gave room for any 
suspicion." 
So they stayed in that house to all 
appearance free from care. Meanwhile, 
Vidura had sent an expert miner who met 
them in secret and said: "My password is 
the veiled warning Vidura gave you. I 
have been sent to help you for your 
protection."  
This 
was 
meant 
to 
indicate 
to 
Yudhishthira 
and 
to 
him 
alone, 
Duryodhana's hideous plot and the means 
of 
escape 
from 
danger. 
Yudhishthira 
answered that he had grasped Vidura's 
meaning, and later he communicated it to 
Kuntidevi.  
Henceforward the miner worked for many 
days in secret, unknown to Purochana, 
and completed a subterranean egress from 
the wax house right under and across the 
walls and the moat, which ran round the 
precincts. 
Purochana had his quarters at the gateway 
of the palace. The Pandavas kept armed 
vigil during night, but by day they used to 
go out hunting in the forest, to all 
appearance bent on pleasure but really to 
make themselves familiar with the forest 
paths.  
As has already been said, they carefully 
kept to themselves their knowledge of the 
wicked plot against their lives. On his side 
Purochana, anxious to lull all suspicion 
and make the murderous fire seem an 
accident, 
waited 
fully 
a 
year 
before 
putting the plot into effect. 
At last Purochana felt he had waited long 
enough. And the watchful Yudhishthira, 
knowing that the fated moment had 
arrived, called his brothers together and 
told them that now or never was the time 
for them to escape. 
Kuntidevi arranged a sumptuous feast for 
the attendants that day. Her idea was to 
lull them to well-fed sleep at night. 
At midnight, Bhima set fire to the palace 
in several places. Kuntidevi and the 
Pandava brothers hurried out through the 
subterranean passage, groping their way 
out in the darkness. Presently, there was a 
roaring fire all over the palace and a fast 
swelling crowd of frightened citizens all 
around in loud and helpless lamentation.  
Some bustled aimlessly in futile efforts to 
put out the conflagration and all joined in 
the cry: "Alas! Alas! This surely is 
Duryodhana's work, and he is killing the 
sinless Pandavas!" 
The 
palace 
was 
reduced 
to 
ashes. 
Purochana's residence was enveloped in 
flames before he could escape and he fell 
an unpitied victim to his own wicked plot.  
The people of Varanavata, sent the 
following message to Hastinapura: "The 
palace which was the abode of the 
Pandavas has burnt down and no one in it 
escaped alive." 
Vyasa has beautifully described the then 
mental state of Dhritarashtra: "Just as the 
water of a deep pool is cool at the bottom 
and warm on the surface, so the heart of 
Dhritarashtra was at once warm with joy 
and chilled with sorrow."  
Dhritarashtra and his sons cast off their 
royal garments in token of mourning for 
the 
Pandavas 
whom 
they 
believed 
consumed 
in 
the 
fire. 
They 
dressed 
themselves in single garments as became 
sorrowful kinsmen and went to the river 
and performed the propitiatory funeral 
rites.  
No 
outward 
show 
of 
heart 
broken 
bereavement was omitted. It was noticed 
by some that Vidura was not so overcome 
by sorrow as the others and this was set 
down to his philosophical bent of mind. 
But the real reason was that he knew that 
the Pandavas had escaped to safety. 
When he looked sad, he was in fact 
following with his mind's eye the weary 
wanderings of the Pandavas. Seeing that 
Bhishma was sunk in sorrow, Vidura 
secretly comforted him by revealing to 
him the story of their successful escape. 
Bhima saw that his mother and brothers 
were exhausted by their nightly vigils as 
well as by fear and anxiety. He therefore 
carried his mother on his shoulders and 
took Nakula and Sahadeva on his hips, 
supporting Yudhishthira and Arjuna with 
his two hands. 
Thus heavily laden, he strode effortlessly 
like a lordly elephant forcing his way 
through the forest and pushing aside the 
shrubs and trees that obstructed his path.  
When they reached the Ganges, there was 
a boat ready for them in charge of a 
boatman who knew their secret. They 
crossed the river in the darkness, and 
entering a mighty forest they went on at 
night in darkness that wrapped them like a 
shroud and in a silence broken hideously 
by the frightful noises of wild animals. 
At last, quite fordone by toil, they sat 
down unable to bear the pangs of thirst 
and overcome by the drowsiness of sheer 
fatigue. Kuntidevi said: "I do not care 
even if the sons of Dhritarashtra are here 
to seize me, but I must stretch my legs." 
She forthwith laid herself down and was 
sunk in sleep.  
Bhima forced his way about the tangled 
forest in search of water in the darkness. 
And finding a pool, he wetted his upper 
garment, made cups of lotus leaves and 
brought water to his mother and brothers 
who were perishing with thirst.  
Then, while the others slept in merciful 
forgetfulness of their woes, Bhima alone 
sat awake absorbed in deep thought. "Do 
not the plants and the creepers of the 
forest mutually help each other and live in 
peace?" he reflected; "why should the 
wicked Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana try 
to injure us in these ways?" Sinless 
himself, Bhima could not understand the 
springs of sinfulness in others and was 
lost in grief. 
The 
Pandavas 
marched 
on, 
suffering 
many hardships and overcoming many 
dangers. Part of the way, they would carry 
their 
mother 
to 
make 
better 
speed. 
Sometimes, tired beyond even heroic 
endurance, they would pause and rest. 
Sometimes, full of life and the glorious 
strength of youth, they would race with 
each other. 
They met Bhagavan Vyasa on the way. 
All of them bowed before him and 
received encouragement and wise counsel 
from him. 
When Kunti told him of the sorrows that 
had befallen them, Vyasa consoled her 
with these words: "No virtuous man is 
strong enough to live in virtue at all times, 
nor is any sinner bad enough to exist in 
one welter of sin. Life is a tangled web 
and there is no one in the world who has 
not done both good and evil. Each and 
everyone has to bear the consequence of 
his actions. Do not give way to sorrow."  
Then they put on the garb of brahmanas, 
as advised by Vyasa, went to the city of 
Ekachakra 
and 
stayed 
there 
in 
a 
brahmana's house, waiting for better days. 
16. THE SLAYING OF BAKASURA 
IN the city of Ekachakra, the Pandavas 
stayed in the guise of brahmanas, begging 
their food in the brahmana streets and 
bringing what they got to their mother, 
who would wait anxiously till their return. 
If they did not come back in time, she 
would be worried, fearing that some evil 
might have befallen them. 
Kunti would divide the food they brought 
in two equal portions. One half would go 
to Bhima. The other half would be shared 
by the other brothers and the mother. 
Bhima, being born of the Wind god had 
great strength and a mighty appetite.  
Vrikodara, one of the names of Bhima, 
means wolf-bellied, and a wolf, you 
know, 
looks 
always 
famished. 
And 
however much it might eat, its hunger is 
never quite satisfied.  
Bhima's insatiable hunger and the scanty 
food he used to get at Ekachakra went ill 
together. And he daily grew thin, which 
caused much distress to his mother and 
brothers. Sometime later, Bhima became 
acquainted with a potter for whom he 
helped and fetched clay. The potter, in 
return, presented him with a big earthen 
pot that became an object of merriment to 
the street urchins.  
One day, when the other brothers had 
gone to beg for alms, Bhimasena stayed 
behind with his mother, and they heard 
loud lamentations from the house of their 
brahmana landlord. Some great calamity 
surely had befallen the poor family and 
Kunti went inside to learn what it was.  
The brahmana and his wife could hardly 
speak for weeping, but, at last the 
brahmana said to his wife: "O unfortunate 
and foolish woman, though time and again 
I wished we should leave this city for 
good, you would not agree. You persisted 
in saying that you were born and bred 
here and here you would stay where your 
parents and relations had lived and died. 
How can I think of losing you who have 
been to me at once my life's mate, loving 
mother, the wife who bore my children, 
nay, my all in all? I cannot send you to 
death while I keep myself alive. This little 
girl has been given to us by God as a trust 
to be handed over in time to a worthy 
man. It is unrighteous to sacrifice her who 
is a gift of God to perpetuate the race. It is 
equally impossible to allow this other, our 
son, to be killed. How can we live after 
consigning to death our only solace in life 
and our hope for the here after? If he is 
lost, who would pour libations for us and 
our ancestors? Alas! You did not pay heed 
to my words, and this is the deadly fruit of 
your perversity. If I give up my life, this 
girl and boy will surely die soon for want 
of a protector. What shall I do? It is best 
that all of us perish together" and the 
brahmana burst forth sobbing. 
The wife replied: "I have been a good 
wife to you, and done my duty by bearing 
you a daughter and a son. You are able, 
and I am not, to bring up and protect your 
children. Just as cast out offal is pounced 
upon and seized by rapacious birds, a poor 
widowed woman is an easy prey to 
wicked and dishonest people. Dogs fight 
for a cloth wet with ghee, and in pulling it 
hither and thither in unclean greed, tear it 
into foul rags. It would be best if I am 
handed over to the Rakshasa. Blessed 
indeed is the woman who passes to the 
other world, while her husband is alive. 
This, as you know, is what the scriptures 
say. Bid me farewell. Take care of my 
children. I have been happy with you. I 
have performed many meritorious actions. 
By my faithful devotion to you, I am sure 
of heaven. Death has no terror for one 
who has been a good wife. After I am 
gone, take another wife. Gladden me with 
a brave smile, give me your blessing, and 
send me to the Rakshasa." 
Hearing these words of his wife, the 
brahmana tenderly embraced her and, 
utterly overcome by her love and courage, 
he wept like a child. When he could find 
his voice, he replied: "O beloved and 
noble one, what words are these? Can I 
bear to live without you? The first duty of 
a married man is to protect his wife. I 
should indeed be a pitiful sinner if I lived 
after giving you up to the Rakshasa, 
sacrificing both love and duty."  
The 
daughter 
who 
was 
hearing 
this 
piteous conversation, now interposed with 
sobs: "Listen to me, child though I be, and 
then do what is proper. It is me alone that 
you can spare to the Rakshasa. By 
sacrificing one soul, that is, myself, you 
can save the others. Let me be the little 
boat to take you across this river of 
calamity. 
In 
like 
manner, 
a 
woman 
without a guardian becomes the sport of 
wicked people who drag her hither and 
thither. It is impossible for me to protect 
two fatherless orphans and they will 
perish miserably like fish in a waterless 
pond. If both of you pass away, both I and 
this little baby brother of mine will soon 
perish unprotected in this hard world. If 
this family of ours can be saved from 
destruction by my single death, what a 
good death mine would be! Even if you 
consider my welfare alone, you should 
send me to the Rakshasa." 
At these brave words of the poor child, the 
parents tenderly embraced her and wept. 
Seeing them all in tears the boy, hardly 
more than a baby, started up with glowing 
eyes, lisping: "Father, do not weep. 
Mother, do not weep. Sister, do not 
weep," and he went to each and sat on 
their lap by turns.  
Then he rose up took a stick of firewood 
and brandishing it about, said in his sweet 
childish treble: "I shall kill the Rakshasa 
with this stick." The child's action and 
speech made them smile in the midst of 
their tears, but only added to their great 
sorrow.  
Feeling 
this 
was 
the 
moment 
for 
intervention, 
Kuntidevi 
entered 
and 
inquired for the cause of their sorrow and 
whether there was anything she could do 
to help them.  
The brahmana said: "Mother, this is a 
sorrow far beyond your aid. There is a 
cave near the city, where lives a cruel and 
terribly strong Rakshasa named Bakasura. 
He forcibly seized this city and kingdom 
thirteen years ago. Since then he has held 
us in cruel thraldom. The kshatriya ruler 
of this country has fled to the city of 
Vetrakiya and is unable to protect us. This 
Rakshasa formerly used to issue from his 
cave whenever he liked and, mad with 
hunger, indiscriminately kill and eat men, 
women and children in this city. The 
citizens prayed to the Rakshasa to come to 
some sort of stipulation in place of this 
promiscuous slaughter. They prayed: 'Do 
not kill us wantonly at your whim and 
pleasure. Once a week we shall bring you 
sufficient 
meat, 
rice, 
curds 
and 
intoxicating 
liquors 
and 
many 
other 
delicacies. We will deliver these to you in 
a carriage drawn by two bullocks driven 
by a human being taken from each house 
in turn. You can make a repast of the rice, 
along with the bullocks and the man, but 
refrain from this mad orgy of slaughter.' 
The Rakshasa agreed to the proposal. 
From that day, this strong Rakshasa has 
been protecting this kingdom from foreign 
raids and wild beasts. This arrangement 
has been in force for many years. No hero 
has been found to free this country from 
this pest, for the Rakshasa has invariably 
defeated and killed all the brave men who 
tried. Mother, our legitimate sovereign is 
unable to protect us. The citizens of a 
country, whose king is weak, should not 
marry and beget children. A worthy 
family life, with culture and domestic 
happiness, is possible only under the rule 
of a good, strong king. Wife, wealth and 
other things are not safe, if there be no 
proper king ruling over us. And having 
long suffered with the sight of others' 
sorrow, our own turn has come now to 
send a person as prey to the Rakshasa. I 
have not the means to purchase a 
substitute. None of us can bear to live 
after sending one of us to a cruel death, 
and so I shall go with my whole family to 
him. Let the wicked glutton gorge himself 
with all of us. I have pained you with 
these things, but you wished to know. 
Only God can help us, but we have lost all 
hope even of that." 
The political truths contained in this story 
of 
Ekachakra 
are 
noteworthy 
and 
suggestive. Kunti talked the matter over 
with Bhimasena and returned to the 
brahmana. She said: "Good man, do not 
despair. God is great. I have five sons. 
One of them will take the food to the 
Rakshasa." 
The brahmana jumped up in amazed 
surprise, but then shook his head sadly 
and would not hear of the substituted 
sacrifice. Kunti said: "O brahmana, do not 
be afraid. My son is endowed with 
superhuman powers derived from mantras 
and will certainly kill this Rakshasa, as I 
have myself seen him kill many other 
such Rakshasas. But keep this a secret, 
for, if you reveal it, his power will come 
to naught." 
Kunti's fear was that, if the story got 
noised abroad, Duryodhana's men would 
see the hand of the Pandavas, and find out 
their where abouts. Bhima was filled with 
unbounded joy and enthusiasm at the 
arrangement made by Kunti.  
The other brothers returned to the house 
with alms. Dharmaputra saw the face of 
Bhimasena radiant with joy to which it 
had long been a stranger and inferred that 
he was resolved on some hazardous 
adventure and questioned Kunti who told 
him everything. 
Yudhishthira said: "What is this? Is not 
this rash and thoughtless? Relying on 
Bhima's strength we sleep without care or 
fear. It is not through Bhima's strength 
and daring that we hope to regain the 
kingdom that has been seized by our 
deceitful enemies? Was it not through the 
prowess of Bhima that we escaped from 
the wax palace? And you are risking the 
life 
of 
Bhima 
who 
is 
our 
present 
protection and future hope. I fear your 
many trials have clouded your judgment!" 
Kuntidevi replied: "Dear sons, we have 
lived happily for many years in the house 
of this brahmana. Duty, nay, man's highest 
virtue, is to repay the benefit he has 
enjoyed by doing good in his turn. I know 
the heroism of Bhima and have no fears. 
Remember 
who 
carried 
us 
from 
Varanavata and who killed the demon 
Hidimba. It is our duty to be of service to 
this brahmana family." 
After 
a 
fierce 
battle, 
the 
Rakshasa 
Bakasura 
was 
slain 
by 
Bhima 
who 
pretended to bring him a cartload of food. 
17. DRAUPADI'S SWAYAMVARAM 
WHILE the Pandavas were living in 
disguise as brahmanas at Ekachakrapura, 
news of the swayamvara of Draupadi, the 
daughter of Drupada, King of Panchala, 
reached 
them. 
Many 
brahmanas 
of 
Ekachakrapura planned to go to Panchala 
in the hope of receiving the customary 
gifts and to see the festivities and pageant 
of a royal wedding. Kunti, with her 
motherly instinct, read her sons' desire to 
go to Panchala and win Draupadi. So she 
told Yudhishthira: "We have been in this 
city so long that it is time to think of 
going somewhere else. We have seen 
these hills and dales till we are tired of 
them. The alms doled out to us are 
diminishing and it is not good to outstay 
your entertainment. Let us therefore go to 
Drupada's kingdom which is reputed to be 
fair and prosperous." Kunti was second to 
none in worldly wisdom and sagacity and 
could gracefully divine her sons' thoughts 
and spare them the awkwardness of 
expressing them.  
The brahmanas went in groups to witness 
the 
swayamvara 
and 
the 
Pandavas 
mingled 
with 
them 
in 
the 
guise 
of 
brahmanas. After a long march the party 
reached the beautiful city of Drupada and 
billeted themselves in the house of a 
potter as obscure brahmanas of no note. 
Though 
Drupada 
and 
Drona 
were 
outwardly at peace, the former never 
could forget or forgive the humiliation he 
had 
suffered 
at 
the 
latter's 
hands. 
Drupada's one wish was to give his 
daughter in marriage to Arjuna.  
Drona loved Arjuna so dearly that he 
could hardly look upon his pupil's father-
in-law as his deadly foe. And if there were 
a war, Drupada would be all the stronger 
for being Arjuna's father-in-law. When he 
heard the news of the destruction of the 
Pandavas at Varanavata, he was plunged 
in sorrow but was relieved by a later 
rumour that they had escaped.  
The 
marriage 
hall 
was 
beautifully 
decorated and built amidst a finely laid 
out group of new guest-houses designed 
to accommodate the swayamvara suitors 
and guests. Attractive sights and sports 
had 
been 
arranged 
for 
public 
entertainment and there were glorious 
festivities for fourteen days continuously. 
A mighty steel bow was placed in the 
marriage hall. The candidate for the 
princess' hand was required to string the 
bow and with it shoot a steel arrow 
through the central aperture of a revolving 
disk at a target placed on high.  
This required almost superhuman strength 
and skill, and Drupada proclaimed that the 
hero who would win his daughter should 
perform this feat. Many valiant princes 
had gathered there from all parts of 
Bharatavarsha. The sons of Dhritarashtra 
were there as well as Karna, Krishna, 
Sisupala, Jarasandha, and Salya.  
Besides the competitors there was a huge 
concourse of spectators and visitors. The 
noise that issued therefrom resembled the 
uproar of the ocean and over it all arose 
the auspicious sound of festal music from 
hundreds of instruments.  
Dhrishtadyumna on horseback rode in 
front of his sister Draupadi seated on an 
elephant. Fresh from her auspicious bridal 
bath, and clad in flowing silk Draupadi 
dismounted and entered the swayamvara 
hall, seeming to fill it with the sweetness 
of her presence and perfect beauty.  
Garland in hand, and coyly glancing at the 
valiant princes, who for their part looked 
at her in speechless admiration, she 
ascended 
the 
dais. 
The 
brahmanas 
repeated the usual mantras and offered 
oblations in the fire. After the peace 
invocation had been chanted and the 
flourish 
of 
music 
had 
stopped, 
Dhrishtadyumna took Draupadi by the 
hand and led her to the center of the hall.  
Then he proclaimed in loud, clear tones: 
"Hear ye, O princes seated in state in this 
assembly, here is the bow. There is the 
target and here are the arrows. He who 
sends five arrows in succession through 
the hole of the wheel and unerringly hits 
the target, if he also be of good family and 
presence, shall win my sister." Then he 
narrated to Draupadi the name, ancestry 
and description of the several suitors 
assembled there. 
Many noted princes rose one after another 
and tried in vain to string the bow. It was 
too heavy and stiff for them, and they 
returned to their places abashed and 
ashamed.  
Sisupala, 
Jarasandha, 
Salya, 
and 
Duryodhana 
were 
among 
these 
unsuccessful aspirants. When Karna came 
forward, all the assemblage expected that 
he would be successful but he failed by 
just a hair's breadth and the string slid 
back flashing and the mighty bow jumped 
out of his hands like a thing of life.  
There was great clamor and angry talk, 
some 
even 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
an 
impossible test put up to shame the kings. 
Then all noises were hushed, for there 
arose from among the group of brahmanas 
a youth who advanced towards the bow.  
It was Arjuna who had come disguised as 
a brahmana. When he stood up; wild 
clamor burst forth again from the crowd.  
The brahmanas themselves were divided 
in opinion. Some being highly delighted 
that there should be among them a lad of 
mettle enough to compete, while others 
more envious or worldly wise, said what 
impudence it was for this brahmacharin to 
enter the lists when heroes like Karna, 
Salya, and others had met with failure.  
But there were others again who spoke 
differently as they noted the noble and 
shapely proportions of the youth. They 
said: "We feel from his appearance that he 
is going to win. He looks sure of himself 
and he certainly knows what he is about. 
The brahmana may be physically weaker, 
but is it all a matter of brute strength? 
What about the power of austerities? Why 
should he not try?" And they blessed him.  
Arjuna approached the place where the 
bow lay and asked Dhrishtadyumna: "Can 
a brahmana try to bend the bow?" 
Dhrishtadyumna answered: "O best of 
brahmanas, my sister will become the life-
mate of any one of good family and 
presence, who bends the bow and shoots 
the target. My words stand and there will 
be no going back on them." 
Then Arjuna meditated on Narayana, the 
Supreme God, and took the bow in his 
hand and strung it with ease. He placed an 
arrow on the string and looked around him 
with a smile, while the crowd was lost in 
spellbound silence.  
Then without pause or hesitation he shot 
five arrows in succession through the 
revolving mechanism right into the target 
so that it fell down. The crowd was in 
tumult and there was a blare of musical 
instruments. 
The brahmanas who were seated in the 
assembly in large numbers sent forth 
shouts of joy, waving aloft their deer-
skins in exultation as though the whole 
community 
had 
won 
Draupadi. 
The 
uproar that followed was indescribable.  
Draupadi shone with a fresh beauty. Her 
face 
glowed 
with 
happiness 
which 
streamed out of her eyes as she looked on 
Arjuna. She approached him and placed 
the garland on his neck. Yudhishthira, 
Nakula, and Sahadeva returned in haste to 
the potter's house to convey the glad news 
immediately to their mother.  
Bhima alone remained in the assembly 
fearing that some danger might befall 
Arjuna from the kshatriyas. As anticipated 
by Bhima, the princes were loud in wrath. 
They said: "The practice of swayamvara, 
the choosing of a bridegroom, is not 
prevalent among the brahmanas. If this 
maiden does not care to marry a prince, 
she should remain a virgin and burn 
herself on the pyre. How can a brahmana 
marry 
her? 
We 
should 
oppose 
this 
marriage and prevent it so as to protect 
righteousness and save the practice of 
swayamvara 
from 
the 
peril 
which 
threatens 
it." 
A 
free 
fight 
seemed 
imminent.  
Bhima plucked a tree by the roots, and 
stripping it of foliage, stood armed with 
this formidable bludgeon, by the side of 
Arjuna ready for any event. Draupadi said 
nothing but stood holding on to the skirts 
of the deer-skin in which Arjuna was clad. 
Krishna, Balarama and others sought to 
appease those who had created the 
confusion. Arjuna proceeded to the house 
of the potter accompanied by Draupadi.  
As 
Bhima 
and 
Arjuna 
were 
taking 
Draupadi 
to 
their 
temporary 
abode, 
Dhrishtadyumna 
followed 
them 
at 
a 
distance, and, unseen by them, closely 
observed everything that took place there. 
He was amazed and delighted at what he 
saw, and returning, he secretly told King 
Drupada: "Father, I think they are the 
Pandavas. Draupadi accompanied them, 
holding to the skirts of the deer-skin of 
that youth and she was not at all abashed. 
I also followed and I saw all five and a 
venerable and august lady who, I have no 
doubt, is Kunti herself."  
Invited 
by 
Drupada 
Kunti 
and 
the 
Pandavas went to the palace. Dharmaputra 
confided to the king that they were the 
Pandavas. He also informed him of their 
decision to marry Draupadi in common.  
Drupada rejoiced at knowing that they 
were the Pandavas, which set at rest all 
anxiety regarding the enmity of Drona. 
But he was surprised and disgusted when 
he heard that they would jointly marry 
Draupadi. 
Drupada opposed this and said: "How 
unrighteous! How did this idea get into 
your head, this immoral idea that goes 
against the traditional usage?"  
Yudhishthira answered: "O king, kindly 
excuse us. In a time of great peril we 
vowed that we would share all things in 
common and we cannot break that pledge. 
Our mother has commanded us so." 
Finally Drupada yielded and the marriage 
was celebrated. 
18. INDRAPRASTHA 
WHEN news of the incidents that took 
place during the swayamvara at Panchala 
reached Hastinapura, Vidura was happy. 
He immediately went to Dhritarashtra and 
said: "O King, our family has become 
stronger because the daughter of Drupada 
has become our daughter-in-law. Our stars 
are good." 
Dhritarashtra 
thought 
in 
his 
blind 
fondness 
for 
his 
son 
that 
it 
was 
Duryodhana, who had also gone to take 
part in the swayamvara, that had won 
Draupadi. Under this mistaken impression 
he replied: "It is indeed, as you say, a 
good time for us. Go at once and bring 
Draupadi. Let us give Panchali a joyous 
welcome." 
Vidura hastened to correct the mistake. He 
said: "The blessed Pandavas are alive and 
it is Arjuna who has won the daughter of 
Drupada. The five Pandavas have married 
her jointly according to the rites enjoined 
by 
the 
sastras. 
With 
their 
mother 
Kuntidevi they are happy and well under 
the care of Drupada." 
At these words of Vidura, Dhritarashtra 
felt 
frustrated 
but 
concealed 
his 
disappointment. He said to Vidura with 
apparent joy: "O Vidura, I am delighted at 
your words. Are the dear Pandavas really 
alive? We have been mourning them as 
dead! The news you have now brought is 
balm to my heart. So the daughter of 
Drupada has become our daughter-in-law. 
Well, well, very good."  
Duryodhana's 
jealousy 
and 
hatred 
redoubled 
when 
he 
found 
that 
the 
Pandavas had somehow escaped from the 
wax palace and after spending a year 
incognito had now become even more 
powerful on account of the alliance with 
the mighty king of Panchala. Duryodhana 
and his brother Duhsasana went to their 
uncle Sakuni and said in sorrow: "Uncle, 
we are undone. We have been let down by 
relying on Purochana. Our enemies, the 
Pandavas, are cleverer than ourselves, and 
fortune 
also 
seems 
to 
favor 
them. 
Dhrishtadyumna 
and 
Sikhandin 
have 
become their allies. What can we do?"   
Karna and Duryodhana went to the blind 
Dhritarashtra. Duryodhana said: "You told 
Vidura that better days were ahead of us. 
Is it good time for us that our natural 
enemies, the Pandavas, have so waxed in 
strength that they will certainly destroy 
us? We could not carry out our plot 
against them and the fact that they know 
about it is an added danger. It has now 
come to this, either we must destroy them 
here and now or we shall ourselves perish. 
Favor us with your counsel in this matter." 
Dhritarashtra replied: "Dear son, what you 
say is true. We should not, however, let 
Vidura know our mind. That was why I 
spoke to him in that manner. Let me now 
hear your suggestions as to what we 
should do." 
Duryodhana said: "I feel so distracted that 
no plan occurs to me. Perhaps, we may 
take advantage of the fact that these 
Pandavas are not born of one and the 
same mother and create enmity between 
the sons of Madri and those of Kunti. We 
can also try to bribe Drupada into joining 
our side. That he has given away his 
daughter in marriage to the Pandavas will 
not stand in the way of our making him an 
ally. There is nothing that cannot be 
accomplished by the power of wealth." 
Karna smiled and said: "This is but futile 
talk."  
Duryodhana 
continued: 
"We 
should 
somehow make sure that the Pandavas do 
not come here and demand of us the 
kingdom that is now in our possession. 
We may commission a few brahmanas to 
spread convenient rumours in Drupada's 
city and severally tell the Pandavas that 
they would meet with great danger if they 
were to go to Hastinapura. Then the 
Pandavas would fear to come here and we 
shall be safe, from them." 
Karna replied: "This too is idle talk. You 
cannot frighten them that way." 
Duryodhana 
continued: 
"Can 
we 
not 
create discord among the Pandavas by 
means of Draupadi? Her polyandrous 
marriage is very convenient for us. We 
shall arouse doubts and jealousies in their 
minds through the efforts of experts in the 
science of erotics. We shall certainly 
succeed. We can get a beautiful woman to 
beguile some of the sons of Kunti and 
thus make Draupadi turn against them. If 
Draupadi begins to suspect any of them, 
we can invite him to Hastinapura and use 
him so that our plan prospers."  
Karna laughed this also to scorn. He said: 
"None of your proposals is any good. You 
cannot 
conquer 
the 
Pandavas 
by 
stratagem. When they were here and were 
like immature birds with undeveloped 
wings, we found we could not deceive 
them, and you think we can deceive them 
now, when they have acquired experience 
and are moreover under the protection of 
Drupada. They have seen through your 
designs. Stratagems will not do hereafter. 
You cannot sow dissensions among them. 
You cannot bribe the wise and honorable 
Drupada. 
He 
will 
not 
give 
up 
the 
Pandavas on any account. Draupadi also 
can 
never 
be 
turned 
against 
them. 
Therefore, there is only one way left for 
us, and that is to attack them before they 
grow stronger and other friends join them. 
We should make a surprise attack on the 
Pandavas and Drupada before Krishna 
joins them with his Yadava army. We 
should take the heroic way out of our 
difficulty, as befits kshatriyas. Trickery 
will prove useless." Thus spoke Karna. 
Dhritarashtra could not make up his mind. 
The king, therefore, sent for Bhishma and 
Drona and consulted them.  
Bhishma was very happy when he heard 
that the Pandavas were alive and well as 
guests of King Drupada of Panchala, 
whose 
daughter 
they 
had 
married. 
Consulted on the steps to be taken, 
Bhishma, wise with the ripe knowledge of 
right and wrong, replied: 
"The proper course will be to welcome 
them 
back 
and 
give 
them 
half 
the 
kingdom. The citizens of the state also 
desire such a settlement. This is the only 
way to maintain the dignity of our family. 
There is much loose talk not creditable to 
you about the fire incident at the wax 
house. All blame, even all suspicion, will 
be set at rest if you invite the Pandavas 
and hand over half kingdom to them. This 
is my advice."  
Drona also gave the same counsel and 
suggested sending a proper messenger to 
bring about an amicable settlement and 
establish peace. 
Karna flew into a rage at this suggestion. 
He 
was 
very 
much 
devoted 
to 
Duryodhana and could not at all bear the 
idea of giving a portion of the kingdom to 
the Pandavas. He told Dhritarashtra: 
"I am surprised that Drona, who has 
received wealth and honors at your hands, 
has made such a suggestion. A king 
should examine critically the advice of his 
ministers before accepting or rejecting it." 
At these words of Karna, Drona, his old 
eyes full of anger, said: "O wicked man, 
you are advising the king to go on the 
wrong path. If Dhritarashtra does not do 
what Bhishma and myself have advised, 
the Kauravas will certainly meet with 
destruction in the near future."  
Then Dhritarashtra sought the advice of 
Vidura who replied: 
"The counsel given by Bhishma, the head 
of our race, and Drona, the master, is wise 
and just and should not be disregarded. 
The Pandavas are also your children like 
Duryodhana and his brothers. You should 
realise that those who advise you to injure 
the Pandavas are really bent upon the 
destruction of the race. Drupada and his 
sons as well as Krishna and the Yadavas 
are staunch allies of the Pandavas. It is 
impossible 
to 
defeat 
them 
in 
battle. 
Karna's advice is foolish and wrong. It is 
reported abroad that we tried to kill the 
Pandavas in the wax house, and we should 
first of all try to clear ourselves of the 
blame. The citizens and the whole country 
are delighted to know that the Pandavas 
are alive and they desire to see them once 
again. Do not listen to the words of 
Duryodhana. Karna and Sakuni are but 
raw youths, ignorant of statesmanship and 
incompetent to advise. Follow Bhishma's 
advice."  
In the end Dhritarashtra determined to 
establish 
peace 
by 
giving 
half 
the 
kingdom to the sons of Pandu. He sent 
Vidura to the kingdom of Panchala to 
fetch the Pandavas and Draupadi. 
Vidura went to the city of King Drupada 
in a speedy vehicle taking along with him 
many kinds of jewels and other valuable 
presents. 
Vidura rendered due honor to King 
Drupada and requested him on behalf of 
Dhritarashtra to send the Pandavas with 
Panchali to Hastinapura.  
Drupada mistrusted Dhritarashtra, but he 
merely said: "The Pandavas may do as 
they like." 
Vidura went to Kuntidevi and prostrated 
himself before her. She said: "Son of 
Vichitravirya, you saved my sons. They 
are, therefore, your children. I trust you. I 
shall do as you advise." She was also 
suspicious of Dhritarashtra's intentions. 
Vidura thus assured her: "Your children 
will never meet with destruction. They 
will inherit the kingdom and acquire great 
renown. Come, let us go." At last Drupada 
also gave his assent and Vidura returned 
to Hastinapura with the Pandavas, Kunti, 
and Draupadi. 
In 
jubilant 
welcome 
of 
the 
beloved 
princes who were returning home after 
long years of exile and travail, the streets 
of Hastinapura had been sprinkled with 
water and decorated with flowers. As had 
been already decided, half the kingdom 
was made over to the Pandavas and 
Yudhishthira was duly crowned king. 
Dhritarashtra blessed the newly crowned 
Yudhishthira and bade him farewell with 
these words: "My brother Pandu made this 
kingdom prosperous. May you prove a 
worthy heir to his renown! King Pandu 
delighted in abiding by my advice. Love 
me in the same manner. My sons are 
wicked and proud. I have made this 
settlement so that there may be no strife or 
hatred 
between 
you. 
Go 
to 
Khandavaprastha 
and 
make 
it 
your 
capital. 
Our 
ancestors 
Pururavas, 
Nahusha, and Yayati ruled the kingdom 
from there. That was our ancient capital. 
Re-establish that and be famous."  In this 
manner Dhritarashtra spoke affectionately 
to Yudhishthira.  
The Pandavas renovated that ruined city, 
built palaces and forts, and renamed it 
Indraprastha. It grew in wealth and beauty 
and became the admiration of the world.  
The Pandavas ruled there happily for 
thirty-six years with their mother and 
Draupadi, never straying from the path of 
dharma. 
19. THE SARANGA BIRDS 
 IN the stories narrated in the Puranas, 
birds and beasts speak like men, and 
sometimes they give sound advice and 
even teach spiritual wisdom. But the 
natural qualities of those creatures are 
adroitly made to peep through this human 
veil.  
One of the characteristic beauties of the 
Puranic literature is this happy fusion of 
nature and imagination. In a delightful 
passage in the Ramayana, Hanuman, who 
is described as very wise and learned, is 
made to frolic with apish joy, when he 
imagined that the beautiful damsel he saw 
at Ravana's inner courtyard was Sita. 
It is usual to entertain children with stories 
in which birds and beasts are made to 
speak. But the stories of the Puranas are 
meant for elderly people, and in them 
usually some background is given in 
explanation of animals having the gift of 
human speech.  
The 
usual 
expedient 
employed 
is 
a 
previous birth when those creatures were 
human beings. For instance, a deer was a 
rishi in a previous birth, or a fox a king. 
The subsequent degradation being due to 
a curse.  
In such cases the deer will act as a deer 
and yet speak as a rishi, and in the fox the 
clever nature is shot through with the 
characteristics of a wise and experienced 
king. 
The 
stories 
are 
thereby 
made 
interesting vehicles of the great truths they 
sometimes convey.  
Khandavaprastha, 
that 
forest 
full 
of 
uneven places and thorns and prickles and 
cumbered with the crumbling vestiges of a 
long dead city, was indeed a frightful 
place when it came into the possession of 
the Pandavas.  
Birds and beasts had made it their abode, 
and it was infested with thieves and 
wicked men. Krishna and Arjuna resolved 
to set fire to the forest and construct a new 
city in its place. 
A saranga bird was living there with its 
four 
fledgelings. 
The 
male 
bird 
was 
pleasantly roaming about in the forest 
with another female bird neglecting wife 
and children. The mother bird looked after 
its young ones.  
As the forest was set on fire as 
commanded by Krishna and Arjuna and 
the fire spread in all directions, doing its 
destructive work, the worried mother bird 
began to lament: 
'The fire is coming nearer and nearer 
burning everything, and soon it will be 
here and destroy us. All forest creatures 
are in despair and the air is full of the 
agonising crash of falling trees. Poor 
wingless babies! You will become a prey 
to the fire. What shall I do? Your father 
has deserted us, and I am not strong 
enough to fly away carrying you with 
me." 
To the mother who was wailing thus, the 
children said:  
"Mother, do not torment yourself on our 
account. Leave us to our fate. If we die 
here, we shall attain a good birth in some 
future life. If you give up your life for our 
sake, our family will become extinct. Fly 
to a place of safety, take another mate and 
be happy. You will soon have other 
children and be able to forget us. Mother, 
reflect and do what is best for our race." 
Despite this earnest entreaty, the mother 
had no mind to leave her children. She 
said: "I shall remain here and perish in the 
flames with you." 
This is the background of the story of the 
birds. A rishi named Mandapala long 
lived faithful to his vow of perfect 
brahmacharya but when he sought entry to 
the higher regions, the gatekeeper said: 
"There is no place here for a childless 
man" and turned him back. He was then 
born as a saranga bird and lived with a 
female companion named Jarita. She laid 
four 
eggs. 
Then 
he 
left 
Jarita 
and 
wandered in the woods with another 
female companion, Lapita. 
The four eggs of Jarita hatched in time 
and they were the four birds mentioned 
above. As they were the children of a rishi 
they could cheer and encourage their 
mother in the way they did.  
The mother bird told her children: "There 
is a rat-hole by the side of this tree. I shall 
put you there. You can get into the hole 
and escape the fire. I shall close the mouth 
of the hole with earth and the fire will not 
touch you. When the fire dies down I shall 
let you out." 
The children would not agree. They said: 
"The rat in the hole will devour us. It is 
better to perish in the flames than to die 
ignobly by being eaten up by rats." 
The mother bird tried to relieve the fears 
of the children and said: "I saw an eagle 
devour the rat. There is now no danger for 
you inside the hole."  
But the children said: "There are sure to 
be other rats in the hole. Our danger is not 
ended by the killing of one rat by the 
eagle. Kindly save your life by flying 
before the fire reaches us and this tree 
catches fire. We cannot get into the rat-
hole. Why should you sacrifice your life 
for our sake? How have we merited it, 
who have done nothing for you? We have 
only brought you unhappiness since we 
came into the world. Take another mate 
and live happily."  
The fire which destroyed the whole forest, 
mercifully left the baby birds unscathed. 
When the fire had subsided, the mother 
bird came back and saw with wonder that 
her 
children 
were 
safe 
and 
chirping 
merrily. She embraced them and was 
intensely happy.  
While the fire was raging, the male bird, 
anxious for the safety of his young ones, 
had expressed his fears to his new love-
bird Lapita. She had petulantly upbraided 
him. Hearing his repeated laments "Is it 
so?" she said: "I know your mind, I know 
that you desire to go back to Jarita, having 
had enough of me. Why falsely bring in 
the fire and the children? You have 
yourself told me that the children of Jarita 
would never perish in fire since the Fire 
god has given you that boon. You may as 
well tell the truth and go away, if you like, 
to your beloved Jarita. I shall only be 
another of the many trusting females 
betrayed by unworthy males and cast out 
wandering in the forest. You may go." 
The 
bird 
Mandapala 
said: 
"Your 
assumption is untrue. I took birth as a bird 
for obtaining children and I am naturally 
anxious about them.  
I shall just go and see them and then come 
back to you " Having thus consoled his 
new mate, be went to the tree where Jarita 
was seated.  
Jarita paid no attention to her consort but 
remained absorbed in joy at finding her 
children alive.  
Then she turned to her husband and asked 
in an indifferent tone why he had come. 
He replied with affection:  
"Are my children happy? Who is the 
eldest among them?"  
Then Jarita cut in icily: "Do you greatly 
care? Go back to her for whom you 
abandoned me. Be happy with her." 
Mandapala philosophised: "A woman will 
not care for her husband after she has 
become a mother. Such is the way of the 
world. Even the blameless Vasishtha was 
thus ignored by Arundhati." 
20. JARASANDHA 
THE Pandavas ruled Indraprastha in all 
glory. 
Those 
who 
surrounded 
Yudhishthira urged him to perform the 
Rajasuya sacrifice and assume the title of 
Emperor. It is evident that imperialism 
had an irresistible glamour even in those 
days. 
Yudhishthira sought Sri Krishna's advice 
in this matter. When Krishna learnt that 
Dharmaputra desired to see him, he set 
out in a chariot harnessed with swift 
horses and reached Indraprastha. 
Yudhishthira said: "'My people urge me to 
perform Rajasuya, but as you know, only 
he who can secure the respect and 
allegiance of all kings, can perform that 
sacrifice and win the status of emperor. 
Advise me, you are not among those 
whose affection makes them blind and 
partial. Nor are you one of those who 
advise to please and whose counsel is 
pleasant rather than true or wholesome." 
Krishna replied: "Quite so and that is why 
you cannot be emperor while the mighty 
Jarasandha of Magadha is alive and 
unconquered. He has conquered many 
kings and holds them in subjection. All 
the kshatriyas, including the redoubtable 
Sisupala himself, are afraid of his prowess 
and are submissive to him. Have you not 
heard of the wicked Kamsa, the son of 
Ugrasena? After he had become the son-
in-law and ally of Jarasandha my people 
and I attacked Jarasandha. After three 
years of continuous fighting we had to 
acknowledge defeat and we left Mathura 
and moved to Dwaraka in the west, and 
built a new city where we are living in 
peace and plenty. Even if Duryodhana, 
Karna and others do not object to your 
assuming the title of emperor, Jarasandha 
will certainly oppose it. And the only way 
to overcome his opposition is to defeat 
and kill him. You can then not only 
perform the Rajasuya but also rescue and 
win the adherence of the kings who 
languish in his prisons." 
At these words of Krishna, Yudhishthira 
said: "I agree. I am but one of the many 
kings 
who 
rule 
their 
kingdoms 
with 
fairness 
and 
justice 
and 
lead 
happy 
unambitious lives. It is mere vanity and 
vainglory to desire to become an emperor. 
Why should not a king rest satisfied with 
his own kingdom? So, I shall give up this 
desire to be an emperor. And really, the 
title has no temptations for me. It is my 
brothers who wish it. When you yourself 
are afraid of Jarasandha what can we hope 
to do?" 
Bhima did not at all like this spirit of 
cowardly contentment. 
Bhima said: "Ambition is the noblest 
virtue of a king. What is the good of being 
strong if one does not know his own 
strength? I cannot reconcile myself to live 
a life of idle ease and contentment. He 
who casts off indolence and properly 
employs political means, can conquer 
even those stronger than himself. Strength 
reinforced by stratagem will surely do 
much. 
What, 
indeed, 
cannot 
be 
accomplished by a combination of my 
physical strength, Krishna's wisdom and 
Arjuna's 
dexterity? 
We 
can 
conquer 
Jarasandha's might, if we three join and 
set about it without doubts or fears." 
Krishna interposed: "Jarasandha should 
certainly be slain and fully deserves it. He 
has unjustly cast eighty-six princes in 
prison. He has planned to immolate a 
hundred kings and is waiting to lay hold 
of fourteen more. If Bhima and Arjuna 
agree, 
I 
shall 
accompany 
them 
and 
together 
we 
will 
slay 
that 
king 
by 
stratagem and set free the imprisoned 
princes. I like this suggestion."  
Yudhishthira was not pleased with this 
advice. He said: "This may really mean 
sacrificing Bhima and Arjuna who are to 
me as my two eyes, merely to gratify a 
vain desire to be an emperor. I do not like 
to send them on this dangerous errand. It 
seems to me far better to give up the idea 
altogether." 
Arjuna said: "What is the use to us of an 
existence without heroic deeds, born as 
we are of an illustrious line? A Kshatriya 
though endowed with all other good 
qualities, will not become famous if he 
does not exert himself. Enthusiasm is the 
mother of success. We can seize fortune if 
we do our duties energetically. Even a 
powerful 
man 
may 
fail 
if, 
through 
lassitude, he does not employ the means 
he has. Failure is due, in the vast majority 
of cases, to ignorance of one's own 
strength. We know we are strong, and we 
are not afraid of using our strength to the 
utmost. Why should Yudhishthira suppose 
that we are incapable of this? When we 
have become old, it will be time to assume 
the ochre robe, resort to the forest and 
pass the rest of our days in penance and 
austerities. Now, we should lead strenuous 
lives and do heroic deeds worthy of the 
traditions of our race." 
Krishna was delighted to hear these words 
and said: "What else can Arjuna, born of 
Kunti in the Bharata race, advise? Death 
comes to all, the hero as well as the 
sluggard. But the noblest duty of a 
kshatriya is to be true to his race and faith, 
and overcoming his foes in righteous 
battle, to win glory." 
Finally 
Yudhishthira 
assented 
to 
the 
unanimous opinion that their duty lay in 
slaying Jarasandha. 
This conversation has a curiously modern 
ring about it and shows that powerful men 
in ancient days used very much the same 
specious reasoning as now. 
21. THE SLAYING OF 
JARASANDHA 
BRIHADRATHA, 
the 
commander 
of 
three regiments, reigned in the kingdom of 
Magadha and attained celebrity as a great 
hero. He married the twin daughters of the 
raja of Kasi and vowed to them that he 
would not show any partiality to either.  
Brihadratha was not blessed with a child 
for a long time. When he became old, he 
handed over his kingdom to his ministers, 
went to the forest with his two wives and 
engaged himself in austerities.  
He went to Sage Kausika of the Gautama 
family, 
with 
a 
sorrowful 
longing 
for 
children in his heart. And when the sage 
was moved with pity and asked him what 
he wanted, he answered: 
"I am childless and have come to the 
forest giving up my kingdom. Give me 
children." 
The sage was filled with compassion and, 
even as he was thinking how to help the 
king, a mango fruit fell into his lap. He 
took it and gave it to the king with this 
blessing: "Take it. Your wish will be 
fulfilled."  
The king cut the fruit into two halves and 
gave one to each wife. He did so to keep 
his vow not to show partiality to either. 
Some time after they had partaken of the 
fruit, the wives became pregnant. 
The delivery took place in due course. But 
instead of bringing the expected joy, it 
plunged them into greater grief than 
before. For they each gave birth to but a 
half of a child. Each half was a monstrous 
birth which seemed a revolting lump.  
They 
were 
indeed 
two 
equal 
and 
complementary portions of one baby, 
consisting of one eye, one leg, half a face, 
one ear and so on. Seized with grief, they 
commanded their attendants to tie the 
gruesome pieces in a cloth and cast them 
away.  
The attendants did as they were instructed 
and threw the cloth bundle on a heap of 
refuse in the street. A cannibal Rakshasi 
chanced upon that place. She was elated at 
seeing the two pieces of flesh and, as she 
gathered them up both at once, accidently 
the halves came together the right way. 
And they at once adhered together and 
changed into a whole living child, perfect 
in every detail.  
The surprised Rakshasi did not wish to 
kill the child. She took on the guise of a 
beautiful woman and, going to the king, 
presented the child to him saying: "This is 
your child." 
The king was immensely delighted and 
handed it over to his two wives. This child 
became known as Jarasandha. He grew up 
in to a man of immense physical strength. 
But his body had one weakness namely, 
that being made up by the fusion of two 
separate parts, it could be split again into 
two, if sufficient force were used. 
This 
interesting 
story 
embodies 
the 
important truth that two sundered parts 
joined together will still remain weak, 
with a tendency to split. When the 
conquest and slaying of Jarasandha had 
been resolved upon, Sri Krishna said: 
"Hamsa, Hidimbaka, Kamsa, and other 
allies of Jarasandha are no more. Now that 
he is isolated, this is the right time to kill 
him.  It is useless to fight with armies. He 
must be provoked to a single combat and 
slain."  
According to the code of honor of those 
days, a kshatriya had to accept the 
challenge to a duel whether with or 
without weapons.  
The latter sort was a fight to the death 
with weighted gauntlets or a wrestling to 
the death in catch-as-catch-can style. This 
was the kshatriya tradition to which 
Krishna and the Pandavas had recourse 
for slaying Jarasandha. 
They disguised themselves as men who 
had taken religious vows, clad in robes of 
bark-fibre and carrying the holy darbha 
grass in their hands. Thus they entered the 
kingdom of Magadha and arrived at the 
capital of Jarasandha. 
Jarasandha was disturbed by portents of ill 
omen. To ward off the threatened danger, 
he had propitiatory rites performed by the 
priests and himself took to fasts and 
penance.  
Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna entered the 
palace unarmed. Jarasandha received them 
with respect as their noble bearing seemed 
to indicate an illustrious origin. Bhima 
and Arjuna made no reply to his words of 
welcome because they wished to avoid 
having to tell lies. 
Krishna spoke on their behalf: "These two 
are observing a vow of silence for the 
present as at part of their austerities. They 
can 
speak 
only 
after 
midnight." 
Jarasandha entertained them in the hall of 
sacrifice and returned to the palace. 
It was the practice of Jarasandha to meet 
noble guests who had taken vows and talk 
to them at their leisure and convenience, 
and so he called at midnight to see them.  
Their 
conduct 
made 
Jarasandha 
suspicious, and he also observed that they 
had on their hands the scars made by the 
bowstring and had besides the proud 
bearing of kshatriyas. 
When Jarasandha demanded the truth of 
them they said frankly: "We are your foes 
and seek instant combat. You can choose 
one of us at will to fight with you." 
After acquainting himself as to who they 
were, Jarasandha said: "Krishna, you are a 
cowherd and Arjuna is a mere boy. Bhima 
is famous for his physical strength. So, I 
wish to fight with him." Since Bhima was 
unarmed, Jarasandha chivalrously agreed 
to fight him without weapons.  
Bhima and Jarasandha were so equally 
matched in strength that they fought with 
each other continuously for thirteen days 
without taking rest or refreshments, while 
Krishna 
and 
Arjuna 
looked 
on 
in 
alternating hope and anxiety.  
On the fourteenth day, Jarasandha showed 
signs 
of 
exhaustion, 
and 
Krishna 
prompted Bhima that the time had come 
to make an end of him.  
At once Bhima lifted him and whirling 
him round and round a hundred times, 
dashed him to the earth and seizing his 
legs tore his body asunder into two halves.  
And Bhima roared in exultation. The two 
halves at once joined and Jarasandha, thus 
made whole, leapt up into vigorous life 
and again attacked Bhima.  
Bhima aghast at the sight, was at a loss 
what to do, when he saw Krishna pick up 
a straw, tear it into two, and cast the bits 
in opposite directions.  
Bhima took the hint, and when once again 
he tore Jarasandha asunder he threw the 
two portions in opposite directions, so that 
they could not come together and join. 
Thus did Jarasandha meet his end. 
The captive princes were released and 
Jarasandha's son was crowned King of 
Magadha. 
And 
Krishna, 
Bhima 
and 
Arjuna returned to Indraprastha. 
With Jarasandha gone, the way was now 
clear for the Rajasuya which the Pandavas 
performed with great pomp and splendor. 
Yudhishthira 
assumed 
the 
title 
of 
emperor. 
The celebrations were marred by only one 
incident. Towards the close of the festive 
celebrations, at the time of paying the first 
honor, Sisupala behaved disrespectfully in 
the assembly of princes and provoked a 
fight with Krishna in which he was slain. 
This story is told in the next chapter. 
22. THE FIRST HONOR 
THE practice of staging a walkout from 
an assembly in protest against something 
is nothing new. We learn from the 
Mahabharata that walkout was resorted to 
even in ancient times. 
The India of those days consisted of a 
number of independent states. Though 
there was one dharma and one culture 
throughout the land, the autonomy of each 
state was scrupulosly respected.  
Occasionally, some strong and ambitious 
monarch would seek the assent of his 
fellow kings to his overlordship, which 
would 
sometimes 
be 
given 
without 
question.  
After receiving this assent he would 
perform a grand Rajasuya sacrifice, which 
all the acquiescing kings would attend in 
token 
of 
acknowledgement 
of 
his 
supremacy.  
In accordance with this custom, the 
Pandavas invited the other kings after the 
slaying of Jarasandha and performed the 
Rajasuya.   
The time came for doing the honors of the 
occasion. The custom was to render first 
honor to the guest who was considered 
most worthy of taking precedence over all 
others.  
The question arose as to who should be 
honored 
first. 
The 
grandsire 
was 
emphatically 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
Sri 
Krishna, the king of Dwaraka, should be 
honored 
first, 
which 
was 
also 
Yudhishthira's own opinion. 
Yudhishthira 
followed 
the 
advice 
and 
under his instructions Sahadeva offered to 
Sri 
Krishna 
the 
honors 
enjoined 
by 
tradition. Sisupala, the king of Chedi, who 
hated Krishna as wickedness alone can 
hate goodness, could not tolerate it. 
He laughed aloud in derision and said: 
"How ridiculous and unjust, but I am not 
surprised. The man who sought advice 
was born in illegitimacy. (This was an 
insulting allusion to the sons of Kunti) 
The man who gave advice was born of 
one who ever declines from high to low. 
(This is in reference to the fact that 
Bhishma was born of Ganga, the river 
naturally flowing from higher to lower 
levels.) And he who did the honors was 
also born illegitimately. And what shall I 
say of the man honored! He is a fool by 
birth and a cowherd by breeding. Dumb 
indeed must be the members of this 
assembly if they have not a word to say to 
this! This is no place for worthy men."  
Some of the assembled princes applauded 
Sisupala. Encouraged by their applause he 
addressed Yudhishthira:  
"When there are so many kings gathered 
here, it is a shame that you paid the first 
honor to Krishna. Not to render respect 
where it is rightly due and to render it 
where it is not merited are both equally 
grave offences. It is a pity that, for all 
your imperial pretensions you are ignorant 
of this." 
Getting more and more angry as he spoke, 
he continued: "Ignoring the many kings 
and heroes who are here at your own 
invitation and in malicious despise of 
them, you have paid royal honors to a 
cowherd boor, a mere nobody. Vasudeva, 
the father of Krishna, was but a servant of 
Ugrasena. He is not even of royal blood. 
Is this the place and the occasion to show 
your vulgar partiality for Krishna, the son 
of Devaki? Is this worthy of the children 
of Pandu? O sons of Pandu, you are raw, 
untaught youths, altogether ignorant of the 
way to conduct a royal assembly. This 
dotard Bhishma guided you foolishly and 
thus made fools of you. Krishna, why, 
Krishna is no ruler at all! O Yudhishthira, 
why did you dare to do this wretch first 
honor in this illustrious assemblage of 
kings? He has not even the merit of age 
and if you admire grey hair, is not his 
father alive? You could not have honored 
him as your preceptor surely, for your 
preceptor is Drona who is here in this 
assembly. Is it as an expert in performing 
sacrifices that you have honored him? It 
cannot be, for Vyasa, the great master, is 
present. It would have been better even if 
you had paid the first honor to Bhishma, 
for dotard as he be, he has still the merit 
of being the oldest man of your house. 
Your family teacher, Kripacharya, is also 
present in this assembly. How could you 
then pay the first honor to this cowherd? 
Ashwatthama, the hero who is expert in 
all sastras, is here. How did you choose 
Krishna, 
forgetting 
him? 
Among 
the 
princes 
assembled 
here, 
there 
is 
Duryodhana. And there is also Karna, the 
disciple 
of 
Parasurama. 
Leaving 
him 
aside, out of childish partiality, you chose 
Krishna for the first honor Krishna who is 
neither royal, nor heroic, nor learned, nor 
holy, nor even hoary, who is nothing but a 
low cowherd! Thus you have dishonored 
us all, whom you have invited here. O 
kings, it is not out of fear that we assented 
to Yudhishthira's assuming the title of 
emperor. We personally do not much care 
whether he is friend or foe. But, having 
heard much prate of his righteousness, we 
wanted to see him uphold the flag of 
dharma. He has now wantonly dishonored 
us, after all that talk of virtue and dharma. 
What virtue or dharma was there in his 
giving priority of honor to this villain 
Krishna who killed Jarasandha in an 
unjust manner?  You should henceforth 
call Yudhishthira an unrighteous person. 
O Krishna, what impudence on your part 
to accept the undeserved honor which 
these misguided Pandavas did you! Did 
you forget yourself? Or did you forget 
decent tradition? Or was it just a case of a 
dog snatching at a remnant of food which 
nobody cared to claim or guard? Do you 
not really see that this farce is a ghastly 
mockery and disgrace to yourself? It is 
like the mockery of showing beautiful 
things to a blind man or offering a maiden 
in marriage to a eunuch. Likewise, these 
kingly honors are really an affront to you. 
It is now evident that the would-be 
emperor 
Yudhishthira, 
the 
senile 
Bhishma, and this fellow Krishna are all 
made of the same stuff."  
After Sisupala had spoken these harsh 
words, he rose from his seat and walked 
out calling upon the other kings to join 
him in resenting the insult. Many of them 
followed him.  
Yudhishthira ran after them and tried to 
appease them with sweet words of peace 
but in vain, for they were too angry to be 
appeased.  
Sisupala's aggressive vanity waxed to 
fighting pitch, and there ensued a terrible 
fight between Krishna and Sisupala, in 
which the latter was slain by his discus.  
The Rajasuya was duly celebrated and 
Yudhishthira recognised emperor. 
23. SAKUNI COMES IN 
AT the close of the Rajasuya, the princes, 
priests and elders, who had gathered for 
the purpose, took leave and returned to 
their places. Vyasa also came to say 
farewell. Dharmaputra rose and received 
him with due respect and sat by his side.  
The sage said: "O son of Kunti, you have 
got the title of emperor which you 
eminently 
deserve. 
May the illustrious 
Kuru race gain even greater glory through 
you. Give me leave to return to my 
hermitage." 
Yudhishthira touched the feet of his 
progenitor and guru and said: "O master, 
you alone can remove my apprehensions. 
Wise men have predicted from portents 
the happenings of catastrophic events. Has 
this prediction been fulfilled by the death 
of Sisupala or is more to ensue?" 
Bhagavan Vyasa replied: "Dear child, 
much sorrow and suffering is in store for 
thirteen years to come. The portents 
indicate the destruction of the Kshatriya 
race and are not exhausted with the death 
of Sisupala. It is far from it.  Hundreds of 
kings will perish, and the old order of 
things will pass away. This catastrophe 
will spring out of the enmity between you 
and your brothers on the one side and 
your cousins, the Dhritarashtras, on the 
other. It will culminate in a war resulting 
in practical annihilation of the Kshatriya 
race. No one can go against destiny. Be 
firm and steadfast in righteousness. Be 
vigilant and rule the kingdom, farewell." 
And Vyasa blessed Yudhishthira. Vyasa's 
words filled Yudhishthira with grief and 
with a great repugnance for worldly 
ambition and life itself.  
He informed his brothers of the prediction 
of 
unavoidable 
racial 
disaster. 
Life 
seemed to him a bitter and weary business 
and his destiny particularly cruel and 
unbearable. 
Arjuna said: "You are a king and it is not 
right for you to be agitated. Let us meet 
destiny with an undaunted front and do 
our duty." 
Yudhishthira replied: "Brothers, may God 
protect us and give us wisdom. For my 
part, I take this vow never to speak 
harshly to my brothers or to my kinsmen 
for the next thirteen years. I shall avoid all 
pretext for conflict. I shall never give way 
to anger, which is the root cause of 
enmity. It shall be my duty to give no 
occasion for anger or pretext for hostility. 
Thus shall we profit by Bhagavan Vyasa's 
warning." His brothers expressed cordial 
assent. 
The first event of the series which 
culminated in the devastating slaughter on 
the blood-sodden field of Kurukshetra and 
the event which was the evil root of all, 
was 
the 
gambling 
match 
into 
which 
Yudhishthira was inveigled by Sakuni, 
who was Duryodhana's evil genius. 
Why did the wise and good Yudhishthira 
suffer himself to be persuaded to this step 
which he must have known to hold evil 
possibilities? 
The main cause was his fixed resolve to 
be on amicable terms with his cousins by 
not opposing their wishes. And a friendly 
invitation to dice could not be summarily 
turned down, since the etiquette of those 
days made it a point of honor to accept a 
game of equal hazard. 
Out of his very anxiety to foster goodwill, 
he laid open the field for the poisonous 
seed of hatred and death. Here is an 
illustration of the futility of human plans, 
however well meant or wise, without 
divine aid. Our best wisdom is vain 
against fate, and if destiny is kind, our 
very follies turn to our advantage. 
While Dharmaputra was care-worn with 
solicitude to avoid a quarrel at all costs, 
Duryodhana was burning with jealousy at 
the thought of the prosperity of the 
Pandavas that he had witnessed in their 
capital during the Rajasuya sacrifice.  
Duryodhana saw unprecedented wealth, 
attractive and sight eluding crystal doors 
and many pieces of exquisite artistry in 
the 
court-hall 
of 
Yudhishthira, 
all 
suggestive of great prosperity. 
He also saw how glad the kings of many 
countries were to become the allies of the 
Pandavas. This gave him unbearable grief. 
He was so absorbed in sorrow at the 
prosperity of the Pandavas that he did not 
at first hear Sakuni who was by his side, 
speaking to him. 
Sakuni asked: "Why are you sighing? 
Why are you tormented with sorrow?" 
Duryodhana 
replied: 
"Yudhishthira, 
surrounded by his brothers, is like Indra, 
the king of gods. Before the very eyes of 
the assembled kings Sisupala was slain 
and not one of them had the courage to 
come forward to avenge him. Like the 
vaisyas who live by trade, they bartered 
their honor and jewels and riches for 
Yudhishthira's goodwill. How can I avoid 
giving way to grief after seeing all this? 
What is the good of living?" 
Sakuni 
said: 
"O 
Duryodhana, 
the 
Pandavas are your brothers. It is not right 
on your part to be jealous of their 
prosperity. They are but enjoying their 
legitimate 
inheritance. 
By 
their 
good 
fortune 
they 
have 
prospered 
and 
flourished without doing any injury to 
others. Why should you be jealous? How 
can their strength and happiness diminish 
your 
greatness? 
Your 
brothers 
and 
relations stand by you and obey you. 
Drona, Ashwatthama and Karna are on 
your side. Why do you grieve when 
Bhishma, Kripa, Jayadratha, Somadatta 
and myself are your supporters? You can 
conquer even the whole world. Do not 
give way to grief."  
At these words, Duryodhana said: "O 
Sakuni, it is true that I have so many to 
support me. Why should we not wage war 
and 
drive 
the 
Pandavas 
out 
of 
Indraprastha?" 
But Sakuni said: "No. That will not be 
easy, but I know a way to drive 
Yudhishthira out of Indraprastha without a 
fight or the shedding of blood."  
The eyes of Duryodhana lighted up, but it 
seemed too good to be true. He asked 
incredulously: "Uncle, is it possible to 
overcome 
the 
Pandavas 
without 
sacrificing any life? What is your plan?" 
Sakuni replied: "Yudhishthira is fond of 
the game of dice and being unskillful is 
altogether ignorant of its tricks and the 
opportunity it offers to cleverer people. If 
we invite him to a game, he would accept, 
following the tradition of the kshatriyas. I 
know the tricks of the game and I shall 
play on your behalf. Yudhishthira will be 
helpless as a child against me. I shall win 
his kingdom and wealth for you without 
shedding a drop of blood." 
24. THE INVITATION 
DURYODHANA and Sakuni went to 
Dhritarashtra. 
Sakuni 
opened 
the 
conversation. 
He 
said: 
"O 
king, 
Duryodhana is wan with grief and anxiety. 
You are paying no attention to his 
unbearable sorrow. Why this unconcern?"  
Dhritarashtra who doted on his son 
embraced Duryodhana and said: "I do not 
see why you should be disconsolate. What 
is here that you already do not enjoy? The 
whole world is at your feet. When you are 
surrounded by all kinds of pleasures like 
the very gods, why should you pine in 
sorrow? You have learnt the Vedas, 
archery, and other sciences from the best 
of masters. As my first born, you have 
inherited the throne. What is left you to 
wish for? Tell me." 
Duryodhana 
replied: 
"Father, 
like 
anybody else, rich or poor, I eat and cover 
my nakedness, but I find life unbearable. 
What is the use of leading such a life?"   
And then he revealed in detail the envy 
and hatred that were eating into his vitals 
and depriving life of its savour. He 
referred to the prosperity he had seen in 
the capital of the Pandavas that to him 
was bitterer than loss of his all would 
have been. 
He burst out: "Contentment with one's lot 
is not characteristic of a kshatriya. Fear 
and pity lower the dignity of kings. My 
wealth and pleasures do not give me any 
satisfaction since I have witnessed the 
greater 
prosperity 
of 
Yudhishthira. 
O 
king, the Pandavas have grown, while we 
have shrunk." 
Dhritarashtra said: "Beloved child, you 
are the eldest son of my royal spouse and 
me and heir to the glory and greatness of 
our renowned race. Do not cherish any 
hatred towards the Pandavas. Sorrow and 
death will be the sole result of hatred of 
kith and kin, especially when they are 
blameless. Tell me, why do you hate the 
guileless 
Yudhishthira? 
Is 
not 
his 
prosperity ours too? Our friends are his 
friends. He has not the least jealousy or 
hatred towards us. You are equal to him in 
heroism and ancestry. Why should you be 
jealous of your brother? No. You should 
not be jealous." Thus said the old king 
who, though overfond of his son, did not 
occasionally hesitate to say what he felt to 
be just.  
Duryodhana did not at all like the advice 
of his father, and his reply was not very 
respectful.  
He replied: "The man without common 
sense, but immersed in learning, is like a 
wooden ladle immersed in savoury food 
which it neither tastes nor benefits from. 
You have much learning of statecraft but 
have no state wisdom at all, as your 
advice to me clearly shows. The way of 
the 
world 
is 
one 
thing 
and 
the 
administration of a state is quite another. 
Thus has Brihaspati said: 'Forbearance 
and contentment, though the duties of 
ordinary men, are not virtues in kings.' 
The kshatriya's duty is a constant seeking 
of victory."  
Duryodhana spoke thus quoting maxims 
of 
politics 
and 
citing 
examples 
and 
making the worse appear the better 
reason.  
Then Sakuni intervened and set forth in 
detail 
his 
infallible 
plan 
of 
inviting 
Yudhishthira to play the game of dice, 
defeating him utterly and divesting him of 
his all without recourse to arms.  
The 
wicked 
Sakuni 
wound 
up 
with 
saying: "It is enough if you merely send 
for the son of Kunti to play the game of 
dice. Leave the rest to me." 
Duryodhana added: "Sakuni will win for 
me the riches of the Pandavas without a 
fight, if you would only agree to invite 
Yudhishthira." 
Dhritarashtra said: "Your suggestion does 
not seem proper. Let us ask Vidura about 
it. He will advise us rightly." 
But 
Duryodhana 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
consulting Vidura. He said to his father: 
"Vidura will only give us the platitudes of 
ordinary morality, which will not help us 
to our object. The policy of kings must be 
very different from the goody maxims of 
textbooks, and is sterner stuff of which the 
test is success. Moreover, Vidura does not 
like me and is partial to the Pandavas. 
You know this as well as I do."  
Dhritarashtra said: "The Pandavas are 
strong. I do not think it wise to antagonize 
them. The game of dice will only lead to 
enmity. The passions resulting from the 
game will know no bounds. We should 
not do it." 
But Duryodhana was importunate: "Wise 
statesmanship lies in casting off all fear 
and protecting oneself by one's own 
efforts. Should we not force the issue 
while yet we are more powerful than they 
are? That will be real foresight. A lost 
opportunity may never come again, and it 
is not as though we invented the game of 
dice to injure the Pandavas. It is an 
ancient pastime which kshatriyas have 
always indulged in, and if it will now 
serve us to win our cause without 
bloodshed, where is the harm?" 
Dhritarashtra replied: "Dear son, I have 
grown old. Do as you like. But the line 
that you are taking does not appeal to me. 
I am sure you will repent later. This is the 
work of destiny."  
In the end, out-argued and through sheer 
fatigue and hopelessness of dissuading his 
son, Dhritarashtra assented, and ordered 
the servants to prepare a hall of games. 
Yet he could not forbear consulting 
Vidura in secret about the matter. 
Vidura 
said: 
"O 
king, 
this 
will 
undoubtedly bring about the ruin of our 
race by raising up unquenchable hate." 
Dhritarashtra, who could not oppose the 
demand of his son, said: "If fortune favors 
us I have no fear regarding this game. If 
on the contrary, fortune goes against us, 
how could we help it? For, destiny is all-
powerful. Go and invite Yudhishthira on 
my behalf to come and play dice." Thus 
commanded, Vidura went to Yudhishthira 
with an invitation. 
The 
weak-witted 
Dhritarashtra, 
over-
persuaded, yielded to the desire of his son 
through his attachment to him in spite of 
the fact that he knew this was the way that 
destiny was working itself out. 
25. THE WAGER 
AT THE sight of Vidura, Yudhishthira 
anxiously inquired: "Why are you so 
cheerless? Is it well with all our relations 
in Hastinapura? Are the king and the 
princes well?" 
Vidura acquainted him with his mission: 
"Everyone in Hastinapura is well. How 
fares it with you all? I have come to invite 
you on behalf of King Dhritarashtra to 
come and see the newly erected hall of 
games. A beautiful hall has been erected 
there even like yours. The king would like 
you to come with your brothers, see 
everything, have a game of dice and 
return to your capital." 
Yudhishthira seemed to ask counsel of 
Vidura: "Wagering games create quarrels 
among kshatriyas. A wise man will avoid 
them if he can. We are ever abiding by 
your advice. What would you have us 
do?" 
Vidura replied: "Everyone is aware that 
the playing of dice is the root of many 
evils. I did my best to oppose this idea. 
Still the king has commanded me to invite 
you and I have come. You may do as you 
like."  
Despite this warning, Yudhishthira went 
to Hastinapura with his brothers and 
retinue. It may be asked why the wise 
Yudhishthira responded to the invitation.  
Three reasons may be given. Men rush 
consciously on their ruin impelled by lust, 
gambling and drink. Yudhishthira was 
fond of gambling. The kshatriya tradition 
made it a matter of etiquette and honor not 
to refuse an invitation to a game of dice.  
There is a third reason too. True to the 
vow he took at the time Vyasa had warned 
him of the quarrels that would arise 
leading 
to 
destruction 
of 
the 
race. 
Yudhishthira would not give any occasion 
for displeasure or complaint by refusing 
the invitation of Dhritarashtra.  
These causes conspired with his natural 
inclination to make Yudhishthira accept 
the invitation and go to Hastinapura. The 
Pandavas and their retinue stopped in the 
magnificent palace reserved for them.  
Yudhishthira rested on the day of arrival, 
and after the daily routine of duties, went 
to the hall of games the next morning.  
After 
the 
exchange 
of 
customary 
greetings, 
Sakuni 
announced 
to 
Yudhishthira that the cloth for playing the 
game had been spread and invited him to 
it. 
Yudhishthira 
at 
first 
said: 
"O 
king, 
gambling is bad. It is not through heroism 
or merit that one succeeds in a game of 
chance. Asita, Devala and other wise 
rishis who were well-versed in worldly 
affairs have declared that gambling should 
be avoided since it offers scope for deceit. 
They have also said that conquest in battle 
is the proper path for the kshatriyas. You 
are not unaware of it."  
But a part of himself, weakened by 
addiction to gambling, was at war with his 
judgment and in his heart of hearts 
Yudhishthira desired to play.  
In his discussion with Sakuni, we see this 
inner conflict.  The keen-witted Sakuni 
spotted this weakness at once and said: 
"What is wrong with the game? What, in 
fact, is a battle? What is even a discussion 
between Vedic scholars? The learned man 
wins victory over the ignorant. The better 
man wins in every case. It is just a test of 
strength or skill, that is all, and there is 
nothing wrong in it. As for the result, in 
every field of activity, the expert defeats 
the beginner, and that is what happens in a 
game of dice also. But if you are afraid, 
you need not play. But do not come out 
with this worn excuse of right and 
wrong." 
Yudhishthira replied: "Well, who is to 
play with me?" 
Duryodhana 
said: 
"Mine 
is 
the 
responsibility for finding the stakes in the 
form of wealth and gems to play the 
game. My uncle Sakuni will actually cast 
the dice in my stead." 
Yudhishthira had thought himself secure 
of defeating Duryodhana in play but 
Sakuni was a different matter, for Sakuni 
was a recognised expert. So he hesitated 
and said: "It is not, I think, customary for 
one man to play on behalf of another."  
Sakuni retorted tauntingly: "I see that you 
are forging another excuse." 
Yudhishthira flushed and, casting caution 
to the winds, replied: "Well, I shall play." 
The hall was fully crowded. Drona, Kripa, 
Bhishma, Vidura, and Dhritarashtra were 
seated there. They knew that the game 
would end viciously and sat unhappily 
witnessing what they could not prevent.  
The assembled princes watched the game 
with great interest and enthusiasm. At first 
they wagered jewels and later gold, silver 
and then chariots and horses. Yudhishthira 
lost continually.  
When he lost all these, Yudhishthira 
staked his servants and lost them also. He 
pledged his elephants and armies and lost 
them too. The dice thrown by Sakuni 
seemed at every time to obey his will. 
Cows, sheep, cities, villages and citizens 
and all other possessions were lost by 
Yudhishthira. 
Still, 
drugged 
with 
misfortune, he would not stop.  
He lost the ornaments of his brothers and 
himself as well as the very clothes they 
wore. Still bad luck dogged him, or rather 
the trickery of Sakuni was too much for 
him. 
Sakuni asked: "Is there anything else that 
you can offer as wager?" 
Yudhishthira said: "Here is the beautiful 
sky-complexioned Nakula. He is one of 
my riches. I place him as a wager." 
Sakuni replied: "Is it so? We shall be glad 
to win your beloved prince." With these 
words Sakuni cast the dice and the result 
was what he had foretold. 
The assembly trembled. 
Yudhishthira said: "Here is my brother 
Sahadeva. He is famous for his infinite 
knowledge in all the arts. It is wrong to 
bet him, still I do so. Let us play."  
Sakuni cast the dice with the words: 
"Here, 
I 
have 
played 
and 
I 
have 
won."Yudhishthira lost Sahadeva too. 
The 
wicked 
Sakuni 
was 
afraid 
that 
Yudhishthira might stop there. So be 
lashed Yudhishthira with these words: 
"To you, Bhima and Arjuna, being your 
full brothers, are no doubt dearer than the 
sons of Madri. You will not offer them, I 
know." 
Yudhishthira, 
now 
thoroughly 
reckless 
and stung to the quick by the sneering 
imputation that he held his step-brothers 
cheap, replied: "Fool, do you seek to 
divide us? How can you, living an evil 
life, understand the righteous life we 
lead?" 
He continued: "I offer as wager the ever-
victorious 
Arjuna 
who 
successfully 
voyages across oceans of battle. Let us 
play."  
Sakuni answered: "I cast the dice" and he 
played. Yudhishthira lost Arjuna also. 
The 
stubborn 
madness 
of 
unbroken 
misfortune 
carried 
Yudhishthira 
further 
and deeper. With tears in his eyes, he said: 
"O king, Bhima, my brother, is our leader 
in battle. He strikes terror into the heart of 
demons and is equal to Indra; he can 
never suffer the least dishonor and he is 
peerless throughout the world in physical 
strength. I offer him as a bet" and he 
played again and lost Bhima too. 
The wicked Sakuni asked: "Is there any 
thing else you can offer?" 
Dharmaputra 
replied: 
"Yes. 
Here 
is 
myself. If you win, I shall be your slave." 
"Look. I win." Thus saying, Sakuni cast 
the dice and won. After that Sakuni stood 
up in the assembly and shouted the names 
of each of the five Pandavas and loudly 
proclaimed that they had all become his 
lawful slaves.  
The assembly looked on in stunned 
silence. 
Sakuni 
alone 
turned 
toYudhishthira and said: "There is one 
jewel still in your possession by staking 
which you can yet free yourself. Can you 
not continue the game cffering your wife 
Draupadi as wager?" 
Yudhishthira despairingly said: "I pledge 
her," and he trembled unwittingly. 
There was audible distress and agitation in 
that part of the assembly where the elders 
sat. Soon great shouts of 'Fie! Fie!' arose 
from all sides. The more emotional wept. 
Others perspired, and felt the end of the 
world was come.  
Duryodhana, 
his 
brothers 
and 
Karna 
shouted with exultation. In that group 
Yuyutsu alone bent his head in shame and 
sorrow and heaved a deep sigh. Sakuni 
cast the dice and shouted again: "I have 
won." 
At once Duryodhana turned to Vidura and 
said: "Go and fetch Draupadi, the beloved 
wife of the Pandavas. She must hence 
forward sweep and clean our house. Let 
her come without delay." 
Vidura exclaimed: "Are you mad that you 
rush to certain destruction? You are 
hanging by a slender thread over a 
bottomless abyss! Drunk with success, 
you do not see it, but it will engulf you!"  
Having 
thus 
reprimanded 
Duryodhana, 
Vidura turned to the assembly and said: 
"Yudhishthira 
had 
no 
right 
to 
stake 
Panchali as by then he had himself already 
lost his freedom and lost all rights. I see 
that the ruin of the Kauravas is imminent, 
and that, regardless of the advice of their 
friends and well-wishers, the sons of 
Dhritarashtra are on the path to hell." 
Duryodhana was angry at these words of 
Vidura 
and 
told 
Prathikami, 
his 
charioteer: "Vidura is jealous of us and he 
is afraid of the Pandavas. But you are 
different. Go forth and bring Draupadi 
immediately." 
26. DRAUPADI'S GRIEF 
PRATHIKAMI went to Draupadi as 
ordered by his master. He said to her: "O 
revered princess, Yudhishthira fell under 
the spell of the game of dice and has 
wagered and lost even you. Now you 
belong to Duryodhana. I have come by 
Duryodhana's command to take you to 
serve in his household as maid servant, 
which will hereafter be your office." 
Draupadi, the spouse of the emperor who 
had 
performed 
Rajasuya, 
was 
dumbfounded, at this strange message. 
She asked: "Prathikami, what do you say? 
Which prince would pledge his wife? Had 
he nothing else to pawn?" 
Prathikami answered: "It is because he 
had already lost all other possessions and 
had nothing else left that he played 
offering you as a stake."  
Then he told her the whole story of how 
Yudhishthira had lost all his wealth and 
had finally betted her, after having first 
forfeited his brothers and himself.   
Though the news was such as to break the 
heart and kill the soul, still, Draupadi soon 
regained her fortitude and, with anger 
blazing from her eyes, said: "O charioteer, 
return. Ask of him who played the game 
whether in it he first lost himself, or his 
wife. Ask this question in the open 
assembly. Bring me his answer and then 
you can take me." Prathikami went to the 
assembly and, turning to Yudhishthira, 
asked 
of 
him 
the 
question 
put 
by 
Draupadi. 
Yudhishthira remained speechless.  
Then Duryodhana bade Prathikami bring 
Panchali herself there to question her 
husband. 
Prathikami 
went 
again 
to 
Draupadi and humbly said: "Princess, the 
mean-minded Duryodhana desires you to 
go to the assembly and ask your question 
yourself." 
Draupadi answered: "No. Return to the 
assembly 
and 
put 
the 
question 
and 
demand an answer."  
Prathikami did so. 
Enraged, 
Duryodhana 
turned 
to 
his 
brother Duhsasana and said: "This man is 
a fool and is afraid of Bhima. Go and 
fetch Draupadi even if you have to drag 
her here." 
Thus commanded, the wicked Duhsasana 
at once sped with joy on his errand. He 
proceeded to the place where Draupadi 
was, shouting: "Come, why do you delay? 
You are now ours. Be not shy, beautiful 
lady. Make yourself agreeable to us, now 
that you have been won by us. Come to 
the assembly" and in his impatience, he 
bade as though to take her thither by 
force.  
Panchali 
rose 
trembling, 
heart-stricken 
with sorrow and started to fly for refuge to 
the inner apartments of Dhritarashtra's 
queen. Duhsasana darted after her, caught 
her by the hair and dragged her to the 
assembly.  
It is with a shudder of repugnance that we 
relate how the sons of Dhritarashtra 
stooped to commit this vilest of deeds. 
As soon as she came to the assembly, 
Draupadi 
controlled 
her 
anguish 
and 
appealed to the elders gathered there: 
"How could you consent to my being 
staked by the king who was himself 
trapped into the game and cheated by 
wicked persons, expert in the art? Since 
he was no longer a free man, how could 
he stake anything at all?"  
Then, stretching out her arms and raising 
her flowing eyes in agonised supplication 
she cried in a voice broken with sobs: 
"If you have loved and revered the 
mothers who bore you and gave you suck, 
if the honor of wife or sister or daughter 
has been dear to you, if you believe in 
God and dharma, forsake me not in this 
horror more cruel than death"' 
At this heart-broken cry, as of a poor fawn 
stricken to death, the elders hung their 
heads in grief and shame. Bhima could 
hold himself no longer. His swelling heart 
found relief in a roar of wrath that shook 
the 
very 
walls, 
and 
turning 
to 
Yudhishthira he said bitterly:  
"Even abandoned professional gamblers 
would not stake the harlots who live with 
them, and you, worse than they, have left 
the daughter of Drupada to the mercy of 
these ruffians. I cannot bear this injustice. 
You are the cause of this great crime. 
Brother Sahadeva, bring fire. I am going 
to set fire to those hands of his which cast 
the dice."  
Arjuna however remonstrated gently with 
Bhima: "You have never before spoken 
thus. The plot devised by our enemies is 
entangling us also in its meshes and 
inciting us to wicked action. We should 
not 
succumb 
and 
play 
their 
game. 
Beware."  
With 
a 
superhuman 
effort, 
Bhima 
controlled his anger. 
Vikarna, the son of Dhritarashtra, could 
not bear the sight of the agony of 
Panchali. He rose up and said: "O 
Kshatriya heroes, why are you silent? I 
am a mere youth, I know, but your silence 
compels me to speak. Listen. Yudhishthira 
was enticed to this game by a deeply 
plotted invitation and he pledged this lady 
when he had no right to do so, because 
she does not belong to Yudhishthira alone. 
For that reason alone the wager is illegal. 
Besides, Yudhishthira had already lost his 
freedom, and being no longer a free man, 
how could he have a right to offer her as a 
stake? And there is this further objection. 
It was Sakuni who suggested her as a 
pledge, which is against the rules of the 
game, under which neither player may 
demand a specific bet. If we consider all 
these points, we must admit that Panchali 
has not been legally won by us. This is my 
opinion." 
When the young Vikarna spoke thus 
courageously, the wisdom given by God 
to the members of the assembly suddenly 
illumined their minds. There were great 
shouts 
of 
applause. 
They 
shouted: 
"Dharma has been saved. Dharma has 
been saved." 
At that moment Karna rose up and said: 
"O Vikarna, forgetting that there are 
elders in this assembly, you lay down the 
law though you are but a stripling. By 
your ignorance and rashness you are 
injuring the very family which gave you 
birth, just as the flame generated by the 
arani destroys its source, the stick. It is an 
ill bird that fouls its own nest. At the very 
beginning, when Yudhishthira was a free 
man, he forfeited all he possessed and 
that, of course, included Draupadi. Hence, 
Draupadi had already come into Sakuni's 
possession. There is nothing more to be 
said in the matter. Even the clothes they 
have on are now Sakuni's property. O 
Duhsasana, seize the garments of the 
Pandavas and the robes of Draupadi and 
hand them over to Sakuni." 
As soon as they heard the cruel words of 
Karna, the Pandavas, feeling that they had 
to stand the test of dharma to the bitter 
end, flung off their upper garments to 
show that they were ready to follow the 
path of honor and right at any cost. 
Seeing this, Duhsasana went to Draupadi 
and made ready to seize her clothes by 
force. All earthly aid had failed, and in the 
anguish 
of 
utter 
helplessness, 
she 
implored divine mercy and succour:  
"O Lord of the World," she wailed, "God 
whom I adore and trust, abandon me not 
in this dire plight. You are my sole refuge. 
Protect me." And she fainted away.  
Then, as the wicked Duhsasana started his 
shameful work of pulling at Panchali's 
robes and good men shuddered and 
averted their eyes, even then, in the mercy 
of God a miracle occurred.   
In vain Duhsasana toiled to strip off her 
garments, for as he pulled off each, ever 
fresh garments were seen to clothe her 
body, 
and 
soon 
a 
great 
heap 
of 
resplendent clothes was piled up before 
the assembly till Duhsasana desisted and 
sat down in sheer fatigue.  
The assembly trembled at this marvel and 
good men praised God and wept. Bhima 
with quivering lips, loudly uttered this 
terrible oath: "May I never go to the blest 
abode of my ancestors if I do not rend the 
breast and drink the heart's blood of this 
sinful 
Duhsasana, 
this 
shame 
of 
the 
Bharata race." 
Suddenly, the howling of jackals could be 
heard. Donkeys and carnivorous birds 
began to send forth weird dissonant cries 
from all sides, portending calamities to 
come.  
Dhritarashtra 
who 
realised 
that 
this 
incident would be the cause of the 
destruction of his race, for once acted with 
wisdom and courage. He called Draupadi 
to his side and attempted to soothe her 
with words of gentleness and affection.  
Then he turned to Yudhishthira and said: 
"You are so blameless that you can have 
no enemies. Forgive in your magnanimity 
the evil done by Duryodhana and dismiss 
all memory of it from your mind. Take 
back 
your 
kingdom 
and 
riches 
and 
everything 
else 
and 
be 
free 
and 
prosperous. Return to Indraprastha." And 
the Pandavas left that accursed hall, 
bewildered and stunned, and seeing a 
miracle 
in 
this 
sudden 
release 
from 
calamity. But it was too good to endure. 
After Yudhishthira and his brothers had 
departed, there was a long and angry 
discussion in the palace of the Kauravas. 
Incited by Duhsasana, Sakuni and others, 
Duryodhana upbraided his father with 
having frustrated their well-laid plans on 
the very threshold of success.  
He quoted Brihaspati's aphorism that no 
device could be considered wrong which 
had as its object the destruction of 
formidable enemies.  
He spoke in detail on the prowess of the 
Pandavas and expressed his conviction 
that the only hope of overcoming the 
Pandavas 
lay 
in 
guile 
and 
taking 
advantage of their pride and sense of 
honor. 
No self-respecting kshatriya could decline 
an 
invitation 
to 
a 
game 
of 
dice. 
Duryodhana secured his doting father's 
reluctant and ominous approval to a plan 
to entice Yudhishthira once again to a 
game of dice. 
A messenger was accordingly dispatched 
after Yudhisthira who had taken his 
departure for Indraprastha. He came up 
with Yudhishthira before the latter had 
reached his destination and invited him on 
behalf of king Dhritarashtra to come back.  
On hearing this invitation, Yudhishthira 
said: "Good and evil come from destiny 
and cannot be avoided. If we must play 
again we must, that is all. A challenge to 
dice cannot in honor be refused. I must 
accept it." Truly, as Sri Vyasa says: 
"There never was and never can be an 
antelope of gold! Yet, Rama went in vain 
pursuit of what seemed one. Surely, when 
calamities are imminent, the judgment is 
first destroyed." 
Dharmaputra returned to Hastinapura and 
set again for a game with Sakuni, though 
everyone in the assembly tried to dissuade 
him.  
He seemed a mere pawn moved by Kali to 
relieve the burden of the world.   
The stake played for was that the defeated 
party should go with his brothers into 
exile to the forest and remain there for 
twelve years and spend the thirteenth year 
incognito. If they were recognised in the 
thirteenth year, they should go again into 
exile for twelve years.  
Needless to say, Yudhishthira met with 
defeat on this occasion also, and the 
Pandavas took the vows of those who are 
to go to the forest.  
All the members of the assembly bent 
down their heads in shame. 
27. DHRITARASHTRA'S ANXIETY 
WHEN the Pandavas set out for the forest, 
there arose a great clamor of lamentation 
from people who thronged the streets and 
climbed the roofs and towers and trees to 
see them go. 
The princes, who, of yore, rode in 
jewelled chariots or on lordly elephants to 
strains of auspicious music, now walked 
away from their birthright on weary feet, 
accompanied by weeping crowds. On all 
sides cries arose of: "Fie and Alas! Does 
not God see this from His heaven?" 
The blind Dhritarashtra sent for Vidura 
and asked him to describe the departure of 
the Pandavas into exile. Vidura replied: 
"Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, went with 
his face covered with a cloth. Bhima went 
behind with his eyes lowered on his arms. 
Arjuna proceeded scattering sand on his 
path. Nakula and Sahadeva besmeared 
their 
bodies 
with 
dust 
and 
closely 
followed 
Yudhishthira. 
Draupadi 
accompanied 
Dharmaputra, 
her 
dishevelled hair covering her face and her 
eyes streaming with tears. Dhaumya, the 
priest, went along with them singing the 
Sama hymns, addressed to Yama, the 
Lord of Death." 
When he heard these words, Dhritarashtra 
was filled with ever-greater fear and 
anxiety than before. He asked: "What do 
the citizens say?" 
Vidura answered: "O great king, I shall 
tell you in their own words what the 
citizens of all castes and creeds say: 'Our 
leaders have left us. Fie on the elders of 
the Kuru race who have suffered such 
things 
to 
happen! 
The 
covetous 
Dhritarashtra and his sons have driven 
away the sons of Pandu to the forest.' 
While the citizens blame us thus, the 
heavens 
are 
vexed 
with 
cloudless 
lightning, and the distressed earth quakes, 
and there are other evil portents." 
While 
Dhritarashtra 
and 
Vidura 
were 
conversing thus, the sage Narada suddenly 
appeared before them. Narada declared: 
"Fourteen 
years 
from 
this 
day 
the 
Kauravas will become extinct as the result 
of the crime committed by Duryodhana" 
and vanished from sight.  
Duryodhana and his companions were 
filled with fear and approached Drona 
with a prayer never to abandon them, 
whatever happened.  
Drona answered gravely: "I believe with 
the wise that the Pandavas are of divine 
birth and unconquerable. Yet my duty is 
to fight for the sons of Dhritarashtra who 
rely on me and whose salt I eat. I shall 
strive for them, heart and soul. But destiny 
is all-powerful. The Pandavas will surely 
return from exile, burning with anger. I 
should 
know 
what 
anger 
is, 
for 
I 
dethroned and dishonored Drupada on 
account 
of 
my 
anger 
towards 
him. 
Implacably revengeful, he has performed 
a sacrifice so that he might be blessed 
with a son who would kill me. It is said 
Dhrishtadyumna is that son. As destiny 
would have it, he is the brother-in-law and 
fast friend of the Pandavas. And things are 
moving as foreordained. Your actions 
tend in the same direction and your days 
are numbered. Lose no time in doing good 
while you may; perform great sacrifice, 
enjoy sinless pleasures, give alms to the 
needy. Nemesis will overtake you in the 
fourteenth year. Duryodhana, make peace 
withYudhishthira this is my counsel to 
you. But, of course, you will do what you 
like." 
Duryodhana was not at all pleased with 
these words of Drona. 
Sanjaya asked Dhritarashtra: "O king, 
why are you worried?" 
The blind king replied: "How can I know 
peace after having injured the Pandavas?" 
Sanjaya said: "What you say is quite true. 
The victim of adverse fate will first 
become perverted, utterly losing his sense 
of 
right 
and 
wrong. 
Time, 
the 
all 
destroyer, does not take a club and break 
the head of a man but by destroying his 
judgment, makes him act madly to his 
own ruin. Your sons have grossly insulted 
Panchali and put themselves on the path 
of destruction."  
Dhritarashtra said: "I did not follow the 
wise path of dharma and statesmanship 
but suffered myself to be misled by my 
foolish son and, as you say, we are fast 
hastening towards the abyss." 
Vidura 
used 
to 
advise 
Dhritarashtra 
earnestly. He would often tell him: "Your 
son 
has 
committed 
a 
great 
wrong. 
Dharmaputra has been cheated. Was it not 
your duty to turn your children to the path 
of virtue and pull them away from vice? 
You should order even now that the 
Pandavas get back the kingdom granted to 
them by you. Recall Yudhishthira from 
the forest and make peace with him. You 
should even restrain Duryodhana by force 
if he will not listen to reason."  
At first Dhritarashtra would listen in sad 
silence when Vidura spoke thus, for he 
knew Vidura to be a wiser man than 
himself 
who 
wished 
him 
well. 
But 
gradually his patience wore thin with 
repeated homilies. 
One day, Dhritarashtra could stand it no 
longer. "O Vidura," he burst out, "you are 
always speaking for the Pandavas and 
against my sons. You do not seek our 
good. Duryodhana was born of my loins. 
How can I give him up? What is the use 
of advising such an unnatural course? I 
have lost my faith in you and do not need 
you anymore. You are free to go to the 
Pandavas if you like." Then, turning his 
back on Vidura, he retired to the inner 
apartments.  
Vidura 
sorrowfully 
felt 
that 
the 
destruction of the Kuru race was certain 
and, taking Dhritarashtra at his word, 
drove in a chariot with fleet horses to the 
forest where the Pandavas lived.  
Dhritarashtra 
was 
filled 
with 
anxious 
remorse. He reflected thin himself: "What 
have I done? I have only strengthened 
Duryodhana, 
while 
driving 
the 
wise 
Vidura to the Pandavas." 
But later he called for Sanjaya and asked 
him to bear a repentant message to Vidura 
imploring him to forgive the thoughtless 
words of an unhappy father and to return.  
Sanjaya hurried to the hermitage where 
the Pandavas were staying and found 
them clad in deer-skin and surrounded by 
sages.  
He also saw Vidura there and conveyed 
Dhritarashtra's message adding  that the 
blind king would die broken-hearted if he 
did not return.  
The soft-hearted Vidura, who was dharma 
incarnate, was greatly moved and returned 
to Hastinapura. 
Dhritarashtra embraced Vidura and the 
difference between them was washed 
away in tears of mutual affection. 
One day, the sage Maitreya came to the 
court of Dhritarashtra and was welcomed 
with great respect. 
Dhritarashtra 
craved 
his 
blessing 
and 
asked 
him: 
"Revered 
sir, 
you 
have 
certainly met my beloved children, the 
Pandavas, in Kurujangala. Are they well? 
Will mutual affection abide in our family 
without any diminution?"  
Maitreya 
said: 
"I 
accidentally 
met 
Yudhishthira in the Kamyaka forest. The 
sages of the place had come to see him. I 
learnt of the events that took place in 
Hastinapura, and I marvelled that such 
things should have been permitted while 
Bhishma and yourself were alive."  
Later, Maitreya saw Duryodhana who was 
also in the court  and advised him, for his 
own good, not to injure but to make peace 
with the Pandavas who were not only 
mighty themselves but related to Krishna 
and Drupada. 
The obstinate and foolish Duryodhana 
merely laughed, slapping his thighs in 
derision and, tearing the ground with his 
feet and without granting an answer, 
turned away.  
Maitreya grew angry and looking at 
Duryodhana said: "Are you so arrogant 
and do you slap your thighs in derision of 
one who wishes you well? Your thighs 
will be broken by a Bhima's mace and you 
will 
die 
on 
the 
battlefield." 
At 
this 
Dhritarashtra jumped up, fell at the feet of 
the sage and begged forgiveness. 
Maitreya said: "My curse will not work if 
your son makes peace with the Pandavas. 
Otherwise it will have effect," and strode 
indignantly out of the assembly. 
28. KRISHNA'S VOW 
As SOON as the news of the slaying of 
Sisupala by Krishna reached his friend 
Salva, he became very angry and besieged 
Dwaraka with a mighty force.  
Krishna 
having 
not 
yet 
returned 
to 
Dwaraka, old Ugrasena was in charge of 
the defence of the city. The sieges 
described in the Mahabharata seem very 
much like those in wars of the present 
day.  
Dwaraka 
was 
a 
strongly 
garrisoned 
fortress built on an island and well 
provided with means of defence. Ample 
barracks had been provided and there was 
an abundant supply of food and weapons 
and the garrison included many illustrious 
warriors.  
Ugrasena imposed a stringent ban upon 
drinking and amusements generally for 
the period of the siege. All the bridges 
were demolished and ships were forbidd 
enentry into ports in the realm. 
Iron spikes were planted in the moats 
around the fortress and the city walls kept 
in good repair.   
All entrances to the city were guarded 
with 
barbed 
wire 
and 
permits 
and 
passwords strictly controlled ingress and 
egress. 
Thus 
no 
arrangements 
were 
neglected that could further strengthen the 
city which nature had already made 
impregnable.  
The pay of the soldiers was increased. 
Volunteers for service were rigidly tested 
before being accepted as soldiers. 
The siege was so rigorously pushed that 
the 
garrison 
suffered 
great 
privations. 
Krishna, when he returned, was struck to 
the heart at the sufferings of his beloved 
city and he compelled Salva immediately 
to raise the siege, by attacking and 
defeating him.  
It was only afterwards that Krishna learnt 
for the first time of the events at 
Hastinapura, the game of dice and the 
exile of the Pandavas. At once be set out 
for the forest where the Pandavas were 
living. 
Along with Krishna went many, including 
men of the Bhoja and Vrishni tribes, 
Dhrishtaketu, 
the 
king 
of 
the 
Chedi 
country, and the Kekayas who were all 
devoted to the Pandavas.  
They 
were 
filled 
with 
righteous 
indignation 
when 
they 
heard 
of 
Duryodhana's perfidy and cried out that 
surely the earth would drink the blood of 
such wicked people.  
Draupadi approached Sri Krishna and, in a 
voice drowned in tears and broken with 
sobs, told the story of her wrongs. She 
said: "I was dragged to the assembly when 
I had but a single garment on my body. 
The sons of Dhritarashtra insulted me 
most outrageously and gloated over my 
agony. They thought that I had become 
their slave and accosted me and treated 
me 
as 
one. 
Even 
Bhishma 
and 
Dhritarashtra forgot my birth and breeding 
and 
my 
relationship 
to 
them. 
O 
Janardhana, even my husbands did not 
protect me from the jeers and the ribald 
insults of those foul ruffians. Bhima's 
bodily strength and Arjuna's Gandiva bow 
were alike of no avail. Under such 
supreme 
provocation 
even 
weaklings 
would have found strength and courage to 
strike the vile insulter dead. The Pandavas 
are renowned heroes and yet Duryodhana 
lives! 
I, 
the 
daughter-in-law 
of 
the 
emperor Pandu, was dragged by my hair. 
I, the wife of five heroes, was dishonored. 
O Madhusudana, even you had deserted 
me." She stood trembling, utterly unable 
to continue, for the grief convulsed her. 
Krishna 
was 
deeply 
moved 
and 
he 
consoled the weeping Draupadi. He said: 
"Those 
who 
tormented 
you 
will 
be 
stricken to death in the bloody quagmire 
of a lost battle. Wipe your eyes. I 
solemnly 
promise 
that 
your 
grievous 
wrongs shall be amply avenged. I shall 
help the Pandavas in every way. You will 
become an empress. The heavens may 
fall, the Himalayas may split in twain, the 
earth may crumble or the boundless sea 
may dry up, but, I tell you verily, my 
words shall stand. I swear this," and 
Krishna 
took 
a 
solemn 
vow 
before 
Draupadi.   
This vow, it will be seen, was in perfect 
accord with the purpose of the Lord's 
avatars, as declared in scriptures:  
"For 
protecting 
the 
righteous, 
for 
destroying the wicked and for firmly 
upholding the law, I am born on earth age 
after age." 
Dhrishtadyumna also consoled his sister 
and told her how nemesis would overtake 
the Kauravas.  
He said: "I will kill Drona, Sikhandin will 
cause Bhishma's fall. Bhima will take the 
lives of the wicked Duryodhana and his 
brothers. Arjuna will slay Karna, the 
charioteer's son."  
Sri Krishna said: "When this calamity 
befell you, I was in Dwaraka. Had I been 
in Hastinapur, I would never have allowed 
this fraudulent game of dice to take place. 
Uninvited, I would have gone there and 
stirred up Drona, Kripa and the other 
elders to a sense of duty. I would, at all 
costs, have prevented this destructive play 
of dice. When Sakuni was cheating you, I 
was 
fighting 
King 
Salva 
who 
had 
besieged my city. It was only after I had 
defeated him that I came to know of the 
game of dice and the subsequent sordid 
story. It grieves me that I am not able to 
remove your sorrows immediately but you 
know, some water must be lost before a 
broken dam is restored."  
Then Krishna took leave and returned to 
Dwaraka with Subhadra, the wife of 
Arjuna, and their child, Abhimanyu.  
Dhrishtadyumna went back to Panchala 
taking with him the sons of Draupadi. 
29. PASUPATA 
IN the beginning of their stay in the forest, 
Bhima and Draupadi used, on occasions, 
to argue with Yudhishthira.  
They would plead that only righteous 
anger 
befitted 
a 
kshatriya 
and 
that 
patience and forbearance under slights and 
insults were not worthy of him. 
They would quote weighty authorities and 
argue vehemently in support of their 
contention. 
Yudhishthira 
would 
firmly 
reply that they should abide by the 
promise 
they 
had 
made 
and 
that 
forbearance was the highest virtue of all.  
Bhima was burning with impatience to 
attack and kill Duryodhana immediately 
and win back the kingdom. He thought it 
unworthy of warriors to continue to dwell 
tamely in the forest.  
Bhima said to Yudhishthira: "You speak 
like those who repeat Vedic mantras and 
are satisfied with the sound of the words 
though ignorant of their meaning.  Your 
intellect has become confused. You are 
born as a kshatriya and yet you do not 
think or behave like one. You have 
become a brahmana by temperament. You 
know, the scriptures enjoin on a kshatriya 
sternness and enterprise. We should not 
let the wicked sons of Dhritarashtra have 
their way. Vain is the birth of a kshatriya 
who 
does 
not 
conquer 
his 
deceitful 
enemies. This is my opinion, and to me, if 
we go to hell by killing a deceitful foe, 
such hell is heaven. Your forbearance 
burns us worse than fire. It scorches 
Arjuna and myself day and night, making 
us sleepless. Those miscreants have seized 
our kingdom by fraud and are enjoying it, 
while you lie torpid like a gorged python. 
You say that we should abide by our 
promise. How can the world-renowned 
Arjuna live incognito? Can the Himalayas 
be hidden under a handful of grass? How 
can the lion-hearted Arjuna, Nakula and 
Sahadeva live in hiding? Can the famous 
Draupadi walk about unrecognized by 
others? Even if we do these impossible 
things, the son of Dhritarashtra will find 
out through his spies. Hence, this promise 
of ours is impossible of performance and 
has been put on us merely to thrust us out 
again for another thirteen years. The 
sastras too support me when I say that a 
filched promise is no promise. A handful 
of grass thrown to a tired bull ought to be 
enough as expiation for breaking such a 
promise. You should resolve to kill our 
enemies immediately. There is no higher 
duty for a kshatriya." 
Bhima was never tired of pressing his 
view. Draupadi also would refer to the 
dishonor she had suffered at the hands of 
Duryodhana, Karna and Duhsasana and 
would 
quote 
authorities 
from 
the 
scriptures that would give Yudhishthira 
anxiety to think.  
He 
would 
sometimes 
answer 
with 
common maxims of politics and refer to 
the relative strength of the parties.  He 
would 
say: 
"Our 
enemy 
has 
such 
adherents 
as 
Bhurisravas, 
Bhishma, 
Drona, 
Karna 
and 
Aswatthama. 
Duryodhana and his brothers are expert in 
warfare. Many feudatory princes, as well 
as mighty monarchs, are now on their 
side. Bhishma and Drona, indeed, have no 
respect for Duryodhana's character, but 
will not give him up and are prepared to 
sacrifice their lives on his side in the 
battlefield. Karna is a brave and skilful 
fighter, well versed in the use of all the 
weapons. 
The 
course 
of 
war 
is 
unpredictable and success is uncertain. 
There is no use in being hasty." Thus 
Yudhishthira managed with difficulty to 
restrain the impatience of the younger 
Pandavas.  
Later, as advised by Vyasa, Arjuna went 
to the Himalayas to practise austerities for 
the purpose of getting new weapons from 
the devas. Arjuna took leave of his 
brothers and went to Panchali to bid her 
farewell.  
She 
said: 
"O 
Dhananjaya, 
may 
you 
prosper in your mission. May God give 
you all that Kuntidevi hoped and wished 
for when you were born. The happiness, 
life, honor and prosperity of us all depend 
on 
you. 
Return 
after 
acquiring 
new 
weapons." Thus Panchali sent him forth 
with auspicious words.   
It is noteworthy that though the voice was 
Draupadi the wife's, yet the benediction 
was Kunti the mother's for the words 
were: "May God give all that Kuntidevi 
wished and hoped for when you were 
born."  
Arjuna passed through dense forests and 
reached the mountain of Indrakila, where 
he met an old brahmana. The ascetic 
smiled and spoke affectionately to Arjuna:  
"Child, you are clad in armor and carry 
weapons. Who are you? Weapons are of 
no use here. What do you seek in this garb 
of a kshatriya in this abode of ascetics and 
saints who have conquered anger and 
passion?" That was Indra, the king of 
gods, who came to have the pleasure of 
meeting his son.  
Arjuna bowed to his father and said: "I 
seek arms. Bless me with weapons." Indra 
replied: "O Dhananjaya, what is the use of 
weapons? Ask for pleasures or seek to go 
to higher worlds for enjoyment." 
Arjuna answered: "O king of gods, I do 
not seek pleasures of higher worlds. I 
have come here after leaving Panchali and 
my brothers in the forest. I seek but 
weapons."  
The 
thousand-eyed said: "If you be 
blessed by the vision of god Siva, the 
three-eyed god, and obtain his grace, you 
will receive divine weapons. Do penance 
unto Siva." 
Thus saying Indra disappeared. Then, 
Arjuna went to the Himalayas and did 
penance to obtain the grace of Siva.   
Siva under the guise of a hunter and 
accompanied 
by 
his 
divine 
spouse 
Umadevi, entered the forest in pursuit of 
game.  
The chase grew fast and furious, and 
presently a wild boar started charging 
Arjuna, who shot an arrow into it with his 
Gandiva bow at the same moment that the 
hunter Siva transfixed it with a shaft from 
his Pinaka bow.  
Arjuna shouted in loud voice: "Who are 
you? Why are you ranging in this forest 
with your wife? How dare you shoot at 
the game I had aimed at?"  
The hunter replied as though in contempt: 
"This forest, full of game, belongs to us, 
who live in it. You do not look tough 
enough to be a forester. Your limbs and 
bearing bespeak a soft luxurious life. It is 
rather for me to ask what you are doing 
here." He also added that it was his shaft 
that had killed the boar, and that if Arjuna 
thought differently be was welcome to 
fight about it. 
Nothing could please Arjuna better. He 
jumped 
up 
and 
showered 
snake-like 
arrows at Siva. To his amazement, they 
seemed to have no effect on the hunter 
and fell back hurtless like storm-driven 
rain from a mountain peak.  
When he had no more arrows, he started 
to strike Siva with his bow. But the hunter 
seemed not to heed it and wrenched with 
ease the bow out of Arjuna's hand and 
burst into laughter.  
Arjuna, who had been disarmed with 
humiliating ease by one who seemed an 
ordinary hunter of the forest, was struck 
with amazement, almost amounting to 
doubt. But undaunted, he drew his sword 
and continued the combat.  
The sword was split into pieces on the 
hunter's adamantine frame. There was 
now nothing to do but to grapple with the 
formidable unknown. But here again he 
was outmatched.  
The hunter caught him in an iron clasp so 
close that Arjuna was quite helpless.  
Worsted 
and 
overmastered, 
Arjuna 
humbly sought divine aid and meditated 
on Siva. As he did so, a light broke on his 
troubled mind, and at once he knew who 
the hunter really was.  
He fell at the feet of the Lord and, in a 
broken voice of repentance and adoration 
he prayed for forgiveness. "I forgive you," 
said Siva smilingly and gave him back his 
Gandiva bow, as well as the other 
weapons, of which he had been deprived. 
He 
also 
bestowed 
on 
Arjuna 
the 
marvellous Pasupata weapon.  
Arjuna's body, battered in the unequal 
combat, was made whole and perfect by 
the divine touch of the three-eyed god and 
became a hundred fold stronger and more 
brilliant than before.  
"Go to heaven and render dutiful respect 
to your father Indra," said Siva and 
vanished from view like the setting sun.  
Arjuna was overcome with joy and 
exclaimed: "Have I really seen the Lord 
face to face and have I been blessed with 
his divine touch? What more do I need?"  
At that moment, Matali, the charioteer of 
Indra, came there with his chariot and 
took Arjuna to the kingdom of the gods. 
30. AFFLICTION IS NOTHING NEW 
BALARAMA and Krishna came with 
their retinue to the abode of the Pandavas 
in the forest. Deeply distressed by what he 
saw, Balarama said to Krishna: 
"O Krishna, it would seem that virtue and 
wickedness bear contrary fruit in this life. 
For see, the wicked Duryodhana is ruling 
his kingdom clad in silk and gold, while 
the virtuous Yudhishthira lives in the 
forest wearing the bark of trees. Seeing 
such unmerited prosperity and undeserved 
privation, men have lost their faith in God. 
The praise of virtue in the sastras seems 
mere mummery when we see the actual 
results of good and evil in this world. 
How will Dhritarashtra justify his conduct 
and defend himself when he is face to face 
with 
the 
god 
of 
death? 
Even 
the 
mountains and the earth weep at the sight 
of the blameless Pandavas dwelling in the 
forests with the blessed Draupadi, born 
from the sacrificial fire."  
Satyaki, who was seated near, said: "O 
Balarama, this is no time for lamenting. 
Should we wait till Yudhishthira asks us 
to do our duty for the Pandavas? While 
you and Krishna and all other relations are 
living, why should the Pandavas waste 
their precious years in the forest? Let us 
collect our forces and attack Duryodhana. 
With the army of the Vrishnis, we are 
surely strong enough to destroy the 
Kauravas. Why, where is the need to foil 
Karna's vaunted archery and cut off his 
head. Let us kill Duryodhana and his 
adherents in the battlefield and hand over 
the 
kingdom 
to 
Abhimanyu 
if 
the 
Pandavas wish to keep their word and stay 
in the forest. This is good for them and 
befits us as men of valor." 
Vasudeva, who was listening carefully to 
this speech, said: "What you say is true. 
But the Pandavas would not like to 
receive from the hands of others what they 
have not won by their own efforts. 
Draupadi for one, born of a heroic race as 
she is, would not hear of it. Yudhishthira 
will 
never 
give 
up 
the 
path 
of 
righteousness for love or fear. When the 
stipulated period of exile is over the kings 
of Panchala, Kekaya and Chedi and 
ourselves will unite our forces to help the 
Pandavas to conquer their enemies." 
Yudhishthira was delighted at these words 
of Krishna. "Sri Krishna knows my mind," 
said he. "Truth is greater than power or 
prosperity and has to be guarded at all 
costs and not the kingdom. When he 
wants us to fight, he shall find us ready. 
The heroes of the Vrishni race may now 
return with the certainty that we shall 
meet again when the time is ripe." With 
these words Yudhishthira gave them leave 
to return.  
Arjuna was still away in the Himalayas 
and 
Bhima's 
anxiety 
and 
impatience 
became well nigh insupportable. He said 
to Yudhishthira:  
"You know that our life depends on 
Arjuna. He has been away very long, and 
we have had no tidings of him. If he 
should be lost to us, then neither the king 
of Panchala, nor Satyaki nor even Sri 
Krishna can save us, and I for one cannot 
survive that loss. All this we owe to that 
mad game of dice, our sorrows and 
sufferings, as well as the growing strength 
of our foes. To be dwelling in the forest is 
not the duty enjoined on a kshatriya. We 
should 
immediately 
recall 
Arjuna 
and 
wage war with the sons of Dhritarashtra, 
with the help of Sri Krishna. I shall be 
satisfied only when the wicked Sakuni, 
Karna and Duryodhana are slain. After 
this clear duty is done, you may, if you 
like, return to the forest and live a life of 
asceticism. It is not a sin to kill by 
stratagem an enemy who has resorted to 
stratagem. I have heard that the Atharva 
Veda 
has 
incantations, 
which 
can 
compress time and reduce its span. If we 
could, by such means, squeeze thirteen 
years into thirteen days, we would be 
perfectly justified in doing so, and you 
will permit me on the fourteenth day to 
kill Duryodhana."  
Hearing 
these 
words 
of 
Bhima, 
Dharmaputra affectionately embraced him 
and sought to restrain his impetuosity. 
"Beloved brother, as soon as the period of 
thirteen years is over, Arjuna, the hero, 
with the Gandiva bow, and yourself will 
fight and kill Duryodhana. Be patient till 
then. Duryodhana and his followers, who 
are sunk in sin, cannot escape. Be assured 
of it." While the sorrow-stricken brothers 
were thus engaged in debate, the great 
sage Brihadaswa came to the hermitage of 
the Pandavas and was received with the 
customary honors.  
After a while, Yudhishthira said to him: 
"Revered sage, our deceitful enemies, 
drew us into this game of dice and cheated 
us of our kingdom and riches, and drove 
my heroic brothers, as well as Panchali 
and myself, to the forest. Arjuna, who left 
us a long time ago to get divine weapons, 
has not returned as yet and we miss him 
sorely. Will he return with divine arms? 
And when will he be back? Surely never 
was there in this world a man who 
suffered so much sorrow as myself."  
The great sage replied: "Do not let your 
mind dwell on sorrow. Arjuna will return 
with divine weapons and you will conquer 
your enemies in the fitness of time. You 
say that there is no one in this world that 
is as unfortunate as you. Now, that is not 
true, though everyone, tried by adversity, 
is 
inclined 
to 
claim 
pre-eminence 
in 
sorrow, because things felt are more than 
things heard or seen. Have you heard of 
king Nala of Nishadha? He suffered more 
sorrows than yourself even in the forest. 
He was deceived by Pushkara at a game 
of dice. He lost his wealth and kingdom 
and had to go in exile to the forest. Less 
fortunate than you, he had not with him 
his brothers or brahmanas. The influence 
of Kali, the spirit of the dark age, deprived 
him of his discrimination and good sense. 
And not knowing what he was doing, he 
deserted his wife who had accompanied 
him, and wandered about in the forest, 
solitary and almost mad. Now, compare 
your 
state 
with 
his. 
You 
have 
the 
company of your heroic brothers and 
devoted wife and are supported by a few 
learned 
brahmanas 
in 
your 
adversity. 
Your mind is sound and steady. Self-pity 
is natural, but you are really not so badly 
off."  
The sage then narrated the life of Nala 
which constitutes twenty-eight chapters of 
the great epic. The sage concluded with 
these words:  
"O Pandava, Nala was tried by sorrows 
more 
agonising 
than 
yours, 
yet 
he 
triumphed over them all and his life ended 
happily. You have the alleviations of 
unclouded intellect and the society of your 
nearest and dearest. You spend much of 
your time in exalted contemplation of 
dharma 
and 
in 
holy 
converse 
with 
brahmanas who are learned in the Vedas 
and 
Vedantas. 
Bear 
your 
trials 
and 
tribulations with fortitude, for they are the 
lot of man and not peculiar to you."  
Thus did the sage Brihadaswa console 
Yudhishthira. 
31. AGASTYA 
THE brahmanas, who had been with 
Yudhishthira 
in 
Indraprastha, 
had 
followed him to the forest. It was difficult 
to maintain such a large establishment.  
Some time after Arjuna had gone on his 
quest of Pasupata, a brahmana sage named 
Lomasa came to the abode of the 
Pandavas.  
He advised Yudhishthira to minimize his 
retinue before going on pilgrimage as it 
would be difficult to move freely from 
place to place with a large following. 
Yudhishthira, who had long felt that 
difficulty, announced to his followers that 
such of them, as were unaccustomed to 
hardship and to hard and scanty fare and 
those who had followed merely in token 
of loyalty, might return to Dhritarashtra 
or, if they preferred it, go to Drupada, the 
King of Panchala.  
Later, with a greatly reduced retinue, the 
Pandavas started on a pilgrimage to holy 
places, acquainting themselves with the 
stories and traditions relating to each. The 
story of Agastya was one such. 
Agastya, it is said, once saw some 
ancestral spirits dangling head down and 
asked them who they were and how they 
had come to be in that unpleasant plight.  
They replied: "Dear child, we are your 
ancestors. If you discharge not your debt 
to us by marrying and begetting progeny, 
there will be no one after you to offer us 
oblations. We have, therefore, resorted to 
this austerity, in order to persuade you to 
save us from this peril."  
When Agastya heard this, he decided to 
marry. 
The king of the country of Vidarbha was 
childless and, so, careworn. He repaired to 
Agastya to get his blessing. In granting 
him the boon, Agastya announced that the 
king would be the father of a beautiful 
girl, who, he stipulated should be given in 
marriage to him.  
Soon the queen gave birth to a girl who 
was named Lopamudra. She grew with 
years into a maiden of such rare beauty 
and charm that she became celebrated in 
the kshatriya world. But no prince dared 
to woo her for fear of Agastya.  
Later, the sage Agastya came to Vidarbha 
and demanded the hand of the king's 
daughter. The king was reluctant to give 
the 
delicately 
nurtured 
princess 
in 
marriage to a sage leading the primitive 
life of a forester but he also feared the 
anger of the sage if he said nay, and was 
plunged in sorrow.  
Lopamudra, greatly concerned, discovered 
the cause of her parent's unhappiness and 
expressed her readiness, nay her desire, to 
marry the sage.  
The king was relieved, and the marriage 
of Agastya and Lopamudra was celebrated 
in due course. When the princess set out 
to accompany the sage, he bade her give 
up her costly garments and valuable 
jewels.  
Unquestioningly 
Lopamudra 
distributed 
her priceless jewels and garments amongst 
her 
companions 
and 
attendants, 
and 
covering herself in deerskin and garments 
of bark, she joyfully accompanied the 
sage.  
During the time Lopamudra and Agastya 
spent 
in 
tapas 
and 
meditation 
at 
Gangadwara, a strong and abiding love 
sprang up between them. For conjugal 
life, Lopamudra's modesty shrank from 
the lack of privacy in a forest hermitage. 
And 
one 
day, 
with 
blushing 
and 
humbleness she expressed her mind to her 
husband. 
She said: "My desire is that I may have 
the royal bedding, the beautiful robes and 
the valuable jewels I had when I was in 
my father's place and that you too may 
have splendid garments and ornaments. 
And then we shall enjoy life to our heart's 
content." 
Agastya smilingly replied: "I have neither 
the wealth nor the facilities to provide 
what you want. Are we not beggars living 
in the forest?" 
But Lopamudra knew her lord's yogic 
power, and said: "Lord, you are all-
powerful 
by 
the 
strength 
of 
your 
austerities. You can get the wealth of the 
whole world in a moment if you but will." 
Agastya said that no doubt that was so, 
but, if he spent his austerities in gaining 
things of such little moment as riches, 
they would soon dwindle to nothing.  
She replied: "I do not wish that. What I 
desire is that you should earn in the 
ordinary way sufficient wealth for us to 
live in ease and comfort." 
Agastya consented and set out as an 
ordinary brahmana to beg of various 
kings. Agastya went to a king who was 
reputed to be very wealthy. The sage told 
the king: "I have come in quest of wealth. 
Give me what I seek, without causing any 
loss or injury to others." 
The king presented a true picture of the 
income and expenditure of the State and 
told him he was free to take what he 
deemed fit. The sage found from the 
accounts that there was no balance left.  
The expenditure of a State turns out 
always to be at least equal to its income. 
This seems to have been the case in 
ancient times also. 
Seeing this, Agastya said: "To accept any 
gift from this king, will be a hardship to 
the citizens. So, I shall seek elsewhere," 
and the sage was about to leave. The king 
said that he would also accompany him 
and both of them went to another State 
where also they found the same state of 
affairs.  
Vyasa thus lays down and illustrates the 
maxim that a king should not tax his 
subjects more than necessary for rightful 
public expenditure and that if one accepts 
as gift anything from the public revenues, 
one adds to the burden of the subjects to 
that extent.  
Agastya thought he had better go to the 
wicked asura Ilvala and try his luck.  
Ilvala and his brother Vatapi cherished an 
implacable 
hatred 
towards 
brahmanas. 
They had curious plan for killing them. 
Ilvala would, with effective hospitality, 
invite a brahmana to a feast.  
By the power of his magic he would 
transform his brother Vatapi into a goat 
and he would kill this pseudo-goat for 
food and serve its meat to the guest. In 
those days, the brahmanas used to eat 
meat. The feast over, Ilvala would invoke 
his brother Vatapi to come out, for he had 
the art of bringing back to life those 
whom he had killed.  
And Vatapi, who as food had entered the 
vitals of the unlucky brahmana, would 
spring up sound and whole and rend his 
way out with fiendish laughter, of course 
killing the guest in doing so.  
In this manner, many brahmanas had died. 
Ilvala was very happy when he learnt that 
Agastya was in the neighborhood, since 
he felt that here was a good brahmana 
delivered into his hands.  
So, he welcomed him and prepared the 
usual feast. The sage ate heartily of Vatapi 
transformed into a goat, and it only 
remained for Ilvala to call out Vatapi for 
the rending scene. And, as usual, Ilvala 
repeated the magic formula and shouted: 
"Vatapi come out!" 
Agastya smiled and, gently rubbing his 
stomach, said: "O Vatapi, be digested in 
my stomach for the peace and good of the 
world." Ilvala shouted again and again in 
frantic fear: "O Vatapi, come forth."  
There was no response and the sage 
explained the reason. Vatapi had been 
digested. The trick had been tried once too 
often. 
The 
asura 
bowed 
to 
Agastya 
and 
surrendered to him the riches he sought. 
Thus 
was 
the 
sage 
able 
to 
satisfy 
Lopamudra's desire. Agastya asked her 
what 
she 
would 
prefer 
whether 
ten 
ordinarily good sons or one super-good 
son with the strength of ten.  
Lopamudra replied she would like to have 
one exceptionally virtuous and learned 
son. The story goes that she was blessed 
with such a gifted son. 
Once the Vindhyas became jealous of the 
Meru Mountain and tried to grow in 
stature, obstructing the sun, the moon and 
the planets. Unable to prevent this danger, 
the gods sought aid from Agastya. The 
sage went to the Vindhya Mountain and 
said:  
"Best of mountains, stop you’re growing 
till I cross you on my way to the south and 
return north again. After my return, you 
can grow, as you like. Wait till then." 
Since the Vindhya Mountain respected 
Agastya, it bowed to his request.  
Agastya did not return north at all, but 
settled in the south and so the Vindhyas 
remain arrested in growth to this day. 
Such is the story as narrated in the 
Mahabharata. 
32. RISHYASRINGA 
IT is an error to think that it is easy for a 
person to lead a life of chastity if he is 
brought up in complete ignorance of 
sensual pleasures. Virtue guarded only by 
ignorance is very insecure as illustrated by 
the following story. It is told in the 
Ramayana also, but not in the same detail.  
Vibhandaka who was resplendent like 
Brahma, the Creator, lived with his son 
Rishyasringa in a forest. The latter had not 
come across any mortal, man or woman, 
except his father.  
The country of Anga was once afflicted 
with a dire famine. Crops had withered for 
want of rain and men perished for lack of 
food. All living things were in distress. 
Romapada, the king of the country, 
approached the brahmanas to advise him 
of some means of saving the kingdom 
from famine.  
The brahmanas replied: "Best of kings, 
there is a young sage called Rishyasringa 
who lives a life of perfect chastity. Invite 
him to our kingdom. He has won the 
power, by his austerities, of bringing rain 
and plenty wherever he goes."  
The king discussed with his courtiers the 
means by which Rishyasringa could be 
brought from the hermitage of the sage 
Vibhandaka. In accordance with their 
advice, 
he 
called 
together 
the 
most 
charming courtesans of the city and 
entrusted 
them 
with 
the 
mission 
of 
bringing Rishyasringa to Anga.  
The damsels were in a quandary. On the 
one hand, they feared to disobey the king. 
On the other, they also feared the sage's 
wrath. Finally, they made up their minds 
to go, relying on Providence to help them, 
in achieving the good work of rescuing 
the stricken land from famine.  
They were suitably equipped for their 
enterprise 
before 
being 
sent 
to 
the 
hermitage.  The leader of this band of 
courtesans made a beautiful garden of a 
big boat, with artificial trees and creepers, 
with an imitation ashrama in the center.  
She had the boat moored in the river near 
Vibhandaka's 
hermitage, 
and 
the 
courtesans 
visited 
the 
hermitage 
with 
quaking hearts. Luckily for them, the sage 
was not at home. Feeling that this was the 
opportune moment, one of the beautiful 
damsels went to the sage's son. 
She thus addressed Rishyasringa: "Great 
sage, are you well? Have you sufficient 
roots and fruits? Are the penances of the 
rishis 
of 
the 
forest 
proceeding 
satisfactorily? 
Is 
your 
father's 
glory 
constantly growing? Is your own study of 
the Vedas progressing?" This was how 
rishis used to accost one another in those 
days.  
The youthful anchorite had never before 
seen such a beautiful human form or heard 
such a sweet voice.  
The 
instinctive 
yearning 
for 
society, 
especially of the opposite sex, though he 
had never seen a woman before, began to 
work on his mind from the moment he 
beheld that graceful form. 
He thought that she was a young sage like 
himself, and felt a strange irrepressible joy 
surging up in his soul. He answered, 
fixing eyes on his interlocutor:  
"You seem to be a bright brahmacharin. 
Who are you? I bow to you. Where is 
your hermitage? What are the austerities 
you are practising?" and he rendered her 
the customary offerings. 
She said to him: "At a distance of three 
yojanas from here is my ashrama. I have 
brought fruits for you. I am not fit to 
receive your prostration, but I shall return 
your greetings and salutation in the way 
customary with us." She embraced him 
warmly, fed him with the sweets she had 
brought, decorated him with perfumed 
garlands, and served him with drinks.  
She embraced him again, saying that that 
was their way of salutation to honored 
guests. He thought it a very agreeable 
way. 
Shortly after, fearing the return of the sage 
Vibhandaka, the courtesan took her leave 
of Rishyasringa saying it was time for her 
to perform the agnihotra sacrifice and 
gently slipped out of the hermitage. 
When 
Vibhandaka 
returned 
to 
the 
hermitage, he was shocked to see the 
place so untidy with sweet meats scattered 
all over, for the hermitage had not been 
cleansed. The shrubs and creepers looked 
draggled and untidy. 
His son's face had not its usual lustre but 
seemed clouded and disturbed as by a 
storm of passion. The usual simple duties 
of the hermitage had been neglected. 
Vibhandaka was troubled and asked his 
son: "Dear boy, why have you not yet 
gathered the sacred firewood? Who has 
broken these nice plants and shrubs? Has 
the cow been milked? Has anyone been 
here to serve you? Who gave you this 
strange garland? Why do you appear 
worried?" 
The simple and ingenuous Rishyasringa 
replied: "A brahmacharin of wonderful 
form was here. I cannot describe his 
brightness and beauty or the sweetness of 
his voice. My inner being has been filled 
with indescribable happiness and affection 
by listening to his voice and looking at his 
eyes. When he embraced me, which it 
seems 
is 
his 
customary 
greeting, 
I 
experienced a joy which I have never felt 
before, no, not even when eating the 
sweetest fruits," and then he described to 
his father the form, beauty and the doings 
of his fair visitor.  
Rishyasringa added wistfully: "My body 
seems to burn with desire for the company 
of that brahmacharin and I should like to 
go and find him and bring him here 
somehow. How can I give you any idea 
about his devotion and brightness? My 
heart pants to see him."  
When Rishyasringa had thus brokenly 
expressed yearnings and disturbances to 
which he had hitherto been a stranger, 
Vibhandaka knew what had occurred. He 
said: "Child, this was no brahmacharin 
that you saw, but a malignant demon who 
sought, as demons do, to beguile us and 
hinder our penances and austerities. They 
take recourse to many kinds of tricks and 
stratagems for the purpose. Do not let 
them come near you."  
After that Vibhandaka searched in vain 
for three days in the forest to find out the 
wretches who had done this injury, and 
returned baffled it his purpose. 
On another occasion, when Vibhandaka 
had gone out of the hermitage to bring 
roots and fruits, the courtesan again came 
softly to the place where Rishyasringa 
was seated. As soon as he saw her at a 
distance, Rishyasringa jumped up and ran 
to greet her gushingly, as pent up water 
surges out of a reservoir that has sprung a 
leak. 
Even without waiting for prompting this 
time, Rishyasringa went near her and after 
the customary salutation said:  "O shining 
brahmacharin, before my father returns let 
us go to your hermitage." 
This was just what she had hoped and 
worked for. And together they entered the 
boat, which had been made to look like a 
hermitage. As soon as the young sage had 
entered, the boat was freed from its 
moorings and floated easily down with its 
welcome freight to the kingdom of Anga.  
As might be expected, the young sage had 
a pleasant and interesting journey and 
when he reached Anga, he certainly knew 
more about the world and its ways than he 
had done in the forest.  
The 
coming 
of 
Rishyasringa delighted 
Romapada infinitely and he took his 
welcome guest to the luxuriously provided 
inner apartments specially prepared for 
him.  
As foretold by the brahmanas, rain began 
to pour the instant Rishyasringa set his 
foot in the country. The rivers and the 
lakes were full and the people rejoiced. 
Romapada gave his daughter Shanta in 
marriage to Rishyasringa. 
Though all ended as he had planned, the 
king was uneasy in his mind, for he was 
afraid that Vibhandaka might come in 
search of his son and pronounce a curse 
on him.  
So, he sought to mollify Vibhandaka by 
lining the route he would take with cattle 
and kind and by instructing the cowherds 
in 
charge 
to 
say 
that 
they 
were 
Rishyasringa's servants and had come to 
welcome and honor their master's father 
and place themselves at his service.  
Not finding his son anywhere in the 
hermitage, 
the 
enraged 
Vibhandaka 
thought that this might be the work of the 
king of Anga.  
He crossed intervening rivers and villages 
and marched to the capital of the king as if 
to burn him in his anger. But as at each 
stage of the journey he saw magnificent 
cattle which belonged to his son and was 
respectfully 
welcomed 
by 
his 
son's 
servants, his angry mood passed gradually 
as he approached the capital.  
When he came to the capital, he was 
received with great honor and taken to the 
king's palace where he saw his son sitting 
in state like the king of the gods in 
heaven. He saw by his side his wife, the 
princess 
Shanta, 
whose 
great 
beauty 
soothed and pleased him. 
Vibhandaka blessed the king. He laid this 
injunction on his son: "Do all that will 
please this king. After the birth of a son, 
come 
and 
join 
me 
in 
the 
forest." 
Rishyasringa did as his father bade him. 
Lomasa concluded the story with these 
words addressed to Yudhishthira: "Like 
Damayanti and Nala, Sita and Rama, 
Arundhati and Vasishtha, Lopamudra and 
Agastya, 
and 
Draupadi 
and 
yourself, 
Shanta and Rishyasringa repaired to the 
forest in the fullness of time and spent 
their lives in mutual love and the worship 
of God. This is the hermitage where 
Rishyasringa. lived. Bathe in these waters 
and be purified." The Pandavas bathed 
there and performed their devotions. 
33. FRUITLESS PENANCE 
IN the course of their wanderings, the 
Pandavas 
reached 
the 
hermitage 
of 
Raibhya on the banks of the Ganga.  
Lomasa told them the story of the place: 
"This is the ghat where Bharata, the son of 
Dasaratha, bathed. These waters cleansed 
Indra of the sin of killing Vritra unfairly. 
Here also Sanatkumara became one with 
God. Aditi, the mother of the gods, 
offered oblations on this mountain and 
prayed to be blessed with a son. O 
Yudhishthira, ascend this holy mountain 
and the misfortunes, which have cast a 
cloud on your life, will vanish. Anger and 
passion will be washed off if you bathe in 
the running waters of this river."  
Then Lomasa expatiated in greater detail 
on the sanctity of the place.  
He began the story thus: "Yavakrida, the 
son of a sage, met with destruction in this 
very place."  
He 
continued: 
"There 
lived 
in 
their 
hermitages 
two 
eminent 
brahmanas, 
named Bharadwaja and Raibhya, who 
were dear friends. Raibhya and his two 
sons, Paravasu and Arvavasu, learnt the 
Vedas 
and 
became 
famed 
scholars. 
Bharadwaja devoted himself wholly to the 
worship of God. He had a son named 
Yavakrida who saw with jealousy and 
hatred that the brahmanas did not respect 
his ascetic father as they did the learned 
Raibhya. 
Yavakrida 
practised 
hard 
penance to gain the grace of Indra. He 
tortured his body with austerities and thus 
awakened the compassion of Indra, who 
appeared and asked him why he so 
mortified his flesh."   
Yavakrida replied: "I wish to be more 
learned in the Vedas than any has ever 
been before. I wish to be a great scholar. I 
am performing these austerities to realise 
that desire. It takes a long time and 
involves much hardship to learn the Vedas 
from a teacher. I am practising austerities 
to acquire that knowledge directly. Bless 
me."  
Indra smiled and said: "O brahmana, you 
are on the wrong path. Return home, seek 
a proper preceptor and learn the Vedas 
from him. Austerity is not the way to 
learning. The path is study and study 
alone." With these words Indra vanished. 
But the son of Bharadwaja would not give 
up.  
He pursued his course of austerities with 
even greater rigor, to the horror and the 
distress 
of 
the 
gods. 
Indra 
again 
manifested himself before Yavakrida and 
warned him again:  
"You have taken the wrong path to 
acquire 
knowledge. 
You 
can 
acquire 
knowledge only by study. Your father 
learnt the Vedas by patient study and so 
can you. Go and study the Vedas. Desist 
from this vain mortification of the body." 
Yavakrida did not heed even this second 
warning of Indra and announced defiantly 
that if his prayer were not granted, he 
would cut off his limbs one by one and 
offer them as oblations to the fire. No, he 
would never give up. 
He continued his penance. One morning, 
during his austerities, when he went to 
bathe in the Ganga, be saw a gaunt old 
brahmana 
on 
the 
bank, 
laboriously 
throwing handfuls of sand into the water.  
Yavakrida asked: "Old man, what are you 
doing?" The old man replied: "I am going 
to build a dam across this river. When, 
with handful after handful, I have built a 
dam of sand here, people can cross the 
river with ease. See how very difficult it is 
at present to cross it. Useful work, isn't 
it?"  
Yavakrida laughed and said: "What a fool 
you must be to think you can build a dam 
across this mighty river with your silly 
handfuls of sand! Arise and take to some 
more useful work." 
The old man said: "Is my project more 
foolish than yours of mastering the Vedas 
not 
by 
study 
but 
by 
austerities?" 
Yavakrida now knew that the old man was 
Indra. More humble this time, Yavakrida 
earnestly begged Indra to grant him 
learning as a personal boon. 
Indra blessed, and comforted Yavakrida 
with the following words: 
"Well, I grant you the boon you seek. Go 
and study the Vedas; you will become 
learned." 
34. YAVAKRIDA'S END 
YAVAKRIDA studied the Vedas and 
became learned. He grew vain with the 
thought 
that 
he 
had 
acquired 
the 
knowledge of the Vedas through the boon 
of Indra and not through human tutelage.  
Bharadwaja did not like this and feared 
that 
his 
son 
might 
ruin 
himself 
by 
slighting Raibhya. He thought it necessary 
to warm him. "The gods," he said, "grant 
boons to foolish people who persistently 
practise penances, as intoxicants are sold 
to fools for money. They lead to loss of 
self-control, and this leads to the warping 
of the mind and utter destruction." He 
illustrated his advice by the ancient tale, 
which is given below. 
In olden times there was a celebrated sage 
named Baladhi. He had a son whose 
untimely death plunged him into grief. So, 
be practised rigorous penance to get a son 
who would never meet with death.  
The gods told the sage that this could 
never be, for the human race was 
necessarily mortal, and there need must be 
a limit to human life. They asked him to 
name his own limit.  
The sage replied: "In that case grant that 
the life of my son may persist as long as 
that 
mountain 
lasts." 
The 
boon 
was 
granted to him and he was duly blessed 
with a son named Medhavi. 
Medhavi grew conceited at the thought 
that he was safe from death forever, since 
he would live as long as the mountain 
existed, and he behaved with arrogance 
towards all.  
One day, this vain man showed disrespect 
to a great sage named Dhanushaksha. At 
once that sage cursed that he might be 
turned to ashes, but the curse took no 
effect on Medhavi who remained in 
perfect health.  
Seeing this, the high-souled sage was 
puzzled and then remembered the gift 
Medhavi had been endowed with at birth.  
Dhanushaksha took the form of a wild 
buffalo and by the power of his penances 
butted at the mountain and broke it to 
pieces and Medhavi fell down dead.  
Bharadwaja concluded the story with this 
solemn 
warning 
to 
his 
son: 
"Learn 
wisdom from this old story. Be not ruined 
by vanity. Cultivate self-restraint. Do not 
transgress the limits of good conduct and 
do not be disrespectful to the great 
Raibhya."  
It was springtime. The trees and creepers 
were beautiful with flowers and the whole 
forest was gorgeous with color and sweet 
with the song of birds.  
The very earth seemed to be under the 
spell of the god of love. Paravasu's wife 
was strolling alone in the garden near the 
hermitage of Raibhya. She appeared more 
than human, in the sweet union in her of 
beauty, courage and purity.  
At that time Yavakrida came there and 
was so overwhelmed by her loveliness 
that he completely lost his sense and self-
control and became as a ravening beast 
with lust.  
He 
accosted 
her 
and 
taking 
brutal 
advantage of her fear and shame and 
bewilderment, he dragged her to a lonely 
pot and violated her person.  
Raibhya returned to his hermitage. He saw 
his 
daughter 
in-law weeping, broken-
hearted and inconsolable and learning of 
the shameful outrage perpetrated on her, 
he was seized with implacable anger. He 
plucked a hair from his bead and offered it 
to the fire reciting a mantra.  
At once, a maiden, as beautiful as his 
daughter-in-law, 
emerged 
from 
the 
sacrificial fire.  
The sage plucked another hair from his 
knotted lock and offered it as oblation. A 
terrible ghost rose from the fire. The sage 
commanded them to kill Yavakrida. Both 
of them bowed to the order.  
While 
Yavakrida 
was 
performing 
the 
morning rites, the female spirit went near 
him and with smiles and allurements put 
him off his guard and as she ran away 
with his water-jug, the male ghost rushed 
on him with uplifted spear.  
Yavakrida stood up in fear. Knowing that 
his mantras would be of no avail until he 
cleansed himself with water, he looked for 
his water-jug. When he found it missing, 
he rushed to a pond for water but the pond 
was dry. He went to nearby stream, which 
also dried up at his approach.  
There was no water for him anywhere. 
The 
terrible 
fiend 
pursued 
him 
everywhere and Yavakrida fled for his 
life, with the demon hot on his heels. His 
sin had consumed the power of his vigils 
and fasts. At last, he sought refuge in the 
sacrificial hall of his father.  
The half-blind man who was guarding the 
hermitage stopped him as be could not 
recognise Yavakrida as, distorted with 
mortal fear, he sought to force his way in. 
Meanwhile, the fiend overtook him and 
killed him with his spear. 
When 
Bharadvaja 
returned 
to 
his 
hermitage, he came upon his son's corpse 
and concluded that disrespect to Raibhya 
must have led to this cruel fate.  
"Alas! My child, you died of your pride 
and vanity. Was it not a great mistake that 
you tried to learn the Vedas in a way not 
resorted to by any brahmana? Why did 
you behave so as to be cursed thus? May 
Raibhya, who caused the death of my only 
son, be himself killed by one of his sons!" 
Thus, carried away by rage and grief the 
sage cursed Raibhya.  
Regaining control soon, he exclaimed in 
anguish: "Alas! They alone are blessed 
who have no sons. I have not only lost my 
only son, but in the madness of my grief I 
have 
also 
cursed 
my 
friend 
and 
companion. What is the use of continuing 
my life?" He cremated his son's body and 
died by throwing himself on the funeral 
pyre. 
35. MERE LEARNING IS NOT 
ENOUGH 
KING Brihadyumna, a disciple of the sage 
Raibhya, performed a great sacrifice at 
which he requested his teacher to let his 
two sons Paravasu and Arvavasu officiate. 
With the permission of their father, both 
of them went joyfully to the capital of the 
king. 
While arrangements were being made for 
the sacrifice, Paravasu desired one day to 
go and see his wife and, walking alone all 
night, he reached his hermitage before 
dawn. Near the hermitage, he saw in the 
twilight, what seemed to him a beast of 
prey crouching for a spring and, hurling 
his weapon at it, killed it.  
But to his horror and grief, he discovered 
that he had killed his own father clad in 
skins, mistaking him for a wild denizen of 
the forest. He realised that the fatal 
mistake was the effect of the curse of 
Bharadwaja.  
When 
he 
had 
hastily 
performed 
the 
funeral rites of his father, he went to 
Arvavasu and told him the doleful tale. He 
said: "But this mishap should not interfere 
with the sacrifice of the king. Please do 
the rites on my behalf in expiation of the 
sin I have unwittingly committed. There 
is, 
mercifully, 
atonement 
for 
sins 
committed in ignorance. If you can be my 
substitute 
here 
for 
undergoing 
the 
expiation I shall be able to go and assist in 
conducting the king's sacrifice. I can 
officiate unaided, which is a thing you 
cannot do as yet."  
The virtuous brother agreed and said: 
"You may attend to the king's sacrifice. I 
shall do penance to free you from the 
terrible taint of having killed a father and 
a brahmana."  
The virtuous Arvavasu, accordingly, took 
upon himself the expiatory rites on behalf 
of his brother. That done, he came to the 
court of the king to join his brother and 
assist in the sacrifice. 
The sin of Paravasu was not washed off, 
since expiation cannot be by proxy. It 
tainted his mind with wicked designs.  
Becoming jealous of the radiance on his 
brother's 
face, 
Paravasu 
decided 
to 
dishonor him by casting on him an 
unjustice as a person and accordingly, 
when Arvavasu entered the hall, Paravasu 
loudly exclaimed so that the king might 
hear:  
"This man has committed the sin of 
killing a brahmana and how can he enter 
this holy sacrificial place?" 
Arvavasu 
indignantly 
denied 
the 
accusation but none heeded him, and he 
was ignominiously expelled from that hall 
of sacrifice by the orders of the king.  
Arvavasu 
repeatedly 
protested 
his 
innocence. "It is my brother who has 
committed the sin and even then it was 
through a mistake. I have saved him by 
performing expiatory rites."  
This made matters worse for him for 
nobody believed that the expiation he had 
undergone was not for his own crime and 
everyone thought that he was adding false 
accusation against a blameless brother, to 
his other sins.  
The virtuous Arvavasu who, besides being 
falsely accused of a monstrous crime, was 
also slandered as a liar, retreated to the 
forest in despair of finding justice in the 
world and betook himself to rigorous 
austerities.  
The gods were gracious and asked him: 
"O virtuous soul, what is the boon you 
seek?" High thinking and deep meditation 
had in the meantime cleansed his heart of 
all anger at his brother's conduct; and so, 
he only prayed that his father might be 
restored to life and that his brother might 
be freed from wickedness and the sins that 
he had committed. 
The gods granted his prayer.  
Lomasa 
narrated 
this 
story 
to 
Yudhishthira at a place near Raibhya's 
hermitage and said: "O Pandavas, bathe 
here and wash off your passions in this 
holy river." 
Arvavasu and Paravasu were both sons of 
a great scholar. Both of them learnt at his 
feet 
and 
became 
eminent 
scholars 
themselves.  
But learning is one thing and virtue is 
quite another. It is true that one should 
know the difference between good and 
evil, if one is to seek good and shun evil. 
But this knowledge should soak into every 
thought and influence every act in one's 
life.  
Then indeed knowledge becomes virtue. 
The knowledge that is merely so much 
undigested information crammed into the 
mind, cannot instill virtue.  
It is just an outward show like our clothes 
and is no real part of us. 
36. ASHTAVAKRA 
WHILE the Pandavas were wandering 
among holy places in the forest, they 
came one day to the hermitage of the 
personages 
immortalized 
in 
the 
Upanishads. Lomasa told Yudhishthira the 
story of that place. 
Udalaka, a great sage and teacher of 
Vedanta, had a disciple named Kagola, 
who was virtuous and devoted but had no 
great learning. So, the other disciples used 
to laugh and mock at him.  
Uddalaka, however, attached no great 
weight to his disciple's lack of erudition 
but really appreciated his virtues, devotion 
and good conduct and gave his daughter 
Sujata in marriage to him. 
The couple was blessed with a son. A 
child generally inherits the characteristics 
of both the parents. But fortunately the 
grandson of Uddalaka took after his 
grandfather rather than his father and 
knew the Vedas even while he was in his 
mother's womb.  
When Kagola made mistakes, as he often 
did in reciting the Vedas, the child in the 
womb would twist his body with pain, and 
so it came to pass that he had eight 
crooked bends in his body when he was 
born.  
These crooked bends earned him the name 
of 
Ashtavakra, 
which 
means 
"Eight 
crooked bends." Kagola, one ill-fated day, 
provoked a polemical contest with Vandi, 
the court scholar of Mithila, and, having 
been defeated, was made to drown 
himself. 
Meanwhile Ashtavakra grew up to be a 
towering scholar even in his boyhood, and 
at the age of twelve he had already 
completed his study of the Vedas and the 
Vedanta.  
One day, Ashtavakra learnt that Janaka, 
the king of Mithila was performing a great 
sacrifice in the course of which the 
assembled 
scholars 
would, 
as 
usual, 
debate on the sastras.  
Ashtavakra 
set 
out 
for 
Mithila, 
accompanied by his uncle Svetaketu. On 
their way to the place of sacrifice at 
Mithila, they came across the king and his 
retinue.  
The attendants of the king marched in 
front shouting: "Move away. Make way 
for the King." Ashtavakra instead of 
moving out of the way said to the 
retainers: 
"O royal attendants, even the king, if he is 
righteous, has to move and make way for 
the blind, the deformed, the fair sex, 
persons bearing loads and brahmanas 
learned in the Vedas. This is the rule 
enjoined by the scriptures."  
The king, surprised at these wise words of 
the brahmana boy, accepted the justness 
of the rebuke and made way, observing to 
his 
attendants: 
"What 
this 
brahmana 
stripling says is true. Fire is fire whether it 
is tiny or big and it has the power to 
burn." 
Ashtavakra and Svetaketu entered the 
sacrificial hall. The gatekeeper stopped 
them and said: "Boys cannot go in. Only 
old men learned in the Vedas may go into 
the sacrificial hall."  
Ashtavakra replied: "We are not mere 
boys. We have observed the necessary 
vows and have learnt the Vedas. Those 
who have mastered the truths of the 
Vedanta will not judge another on mere 
considerations of age or appearance."  
The gatekeeper said: "Stop. Have done 
with your idle brag. How can you, a mere 
boy, 
have 
learnt 
and 
realised 
the 
Vedanta?" 
The boy said: "You mean I am not big like 
an over-grown gourd with no substance in 
it? Size is no indication of knowledge or 
worth, nor is age. A very tall old man may 
be a tall old fool. Let me pass." 
The gatekeeper said: "You are certainly 
not old, nor tall, though you talk like all 
the hoary sages. Get out."  
Ashtavakra 
replied: 
"Gatekeeper, 
Grey 
hairs do not prove the ripeness of the soul. 
The really mature man is the one who has 
learnt the Vedas and the Vedangas, 
mastered their gist and realised their 
essence. I am here to meet the court pandit 
Vandi. Inform King Janaka of my desire."  
At that moment the king himself came 
there and easily recognized Ashtavakra, 
the precociously wise boy he had met 
before. 
The king asked: "Do you know that my 
court pandit Vandi has overthrown in 
argument many great scholars in the past 
and caused them to be cast into the ocean? 
Does that not deter you from this 
dangerous adventure?" 
Ashtavakra 
replied: 
"Your 
eminent 
scholar has not hitherto encountered men 
like me who are proficient in the Vedas on 
Vedanta. He has become arrogant and 
vain with easy victories over good men 
who were not real scholars. I have come 
here to repay the debt due on account of 
my father, who was defeated by this man 
and made to drown himself, as I have 
heard from my mother. I have no doubt I 
shall vanquish Vandi, whom you will see 
crumple up like a broken-wheeled cart. 
Please summon him." 
Ashtavakra met Vandi. They took up a 
debatable thesis and started an argument, 
each employing his utmost learning and 
wits to confound the other. And in the end 
the assembly unanimously declared the 
victory of Ashtavakra and the defeat of 
Vandi.  
The court pandit of Mithila bowed his 
head and paid the forfeit by drowning 
himself in the ocean and going to the 
abode 
of 
Varuna.Then 
the 
spirit 
of 
Kagola, the father of Ashtavakra, gained 
peace and joy in the glory of his son.  
The author of the epic instructs us through 
these words put in Kagola's mouth: "A 
son need not be like his father. A father 
who is physically weak may have a very 
strong son and an ignorant father may 
have a scholarly son. It is wrong to 
acesess the greatness of a man on his 
physical 
appearance 
or 
age. 
External 
appearances are deceptive."  Which shows 
that the unlearned Kagola was not devoid 
of common sense. 
37. BHIMA AND HANUMAN 
DRAUPADI used to complain frequently: 
"This Kamyaka forest is not beautiful 
without Arjuna. I find no joy in life in the 
absence of Arjuna." 
The other Pandavas shared Draupadi's 
wretchedness at separation from Arjuna, 
who had gone to the Himalayas in quest 
of divine weapons. 
Bhimasena told Draupadi: "Blessed lady, I 
myself feel the same about Arjuna and 
what you say makes me thrill with love 
and sympathy. Bereft of Arjuna, this 
beautiful forest seems desolate. My mind 
can know no peace without seeing Arjuna. 
Sahadeva, how do you feel?"  
Sahadeva said: "This hermitage seems to 
be empty without Arjuna. We shall try 
whether a change of scene will help us to 
bear the pain of separation better." 
Yudhishthira 
addressing 
his 
priest 
Dhaumya said: "I have sent my younger 
brother Arjuna to win divine weapons. 
That dauntless and dexterous hero has not 
yet returned. We have sent him to the 
Himalayas to get from Indra, the king of 
gods, weapons with which we could 
conquer 
Bhishma, 
Drona, 
Kripa 
and 
Aswatthama, since it is certain that these 
heroes will fight on the side of the sons of 
Dhritarashtra. Karna knows the secret of 
divine weapons, and his supreme wish is 
to fight with Arjuna. I have sent Arjuna to 
gain Indra's grace and get weapons from 
him as the Kaurava heroes can be defeated 
by no other means. Having sent him on a 
very difficult errand, we cannot live here 
happily, for we miss him in all our 
accustomed 
haunts. 
I 
wish 
to 
go 
elsewhere, for that may enable us to bear 
the separation better. Can you suggest 
where we could go?"  
Dhaumya described many forests and holy 
places. The Pandavas went the round of 
those places to relieve themselves to some 
extent from the pangs of separation.  
They spent many years in this pilgrimage 
and in listening to the traditions, which 
sanctified each shrine. Draupadi would 
often feel exhausted by having to traverse 
mountains and forests. Bhima, sometimes 
helped by his son Ghalotkacha, would 
serve and encourage them and make their 
labors easy.  
In the course of their wanderings through 
the Himalayan regions they came to a 
terrible forest where the path was rugged 
and steep.  
Yudhishthira was worried and told Bhima 
that 
the 
way 
would 
greatly 
distress 
Draupadi but that he himself would go on 
accompanied by Nakula and the sage 
Lomasa.  
He suggested that Bhima and Sahadeva 
should stay behind at Gangadwara with 
Draupadi. Bhima would not agree. He 
said that the pain of separation from 
Arjuna ought to have taught his brother 
how much he would suffer if he were 
parted from Sahadeva, Draupadi and 
Bhima.  
Besides, 
Bhima 
could 
not 
leave 
Yudhishthira alone in this forest infested 
with 
Rakshasas, 
demons 
and 
wild 
animals. The way was hard, but he could 
easily carry Draupadi across the most 
difficult parts of it. He could carry Nakula 
and Sahadeva also. 
When 
Bhima 
said 
these 
words, 
Yudhishthira embraced him and blessed 
him and wished him an increase of 
physical strength. Draupadi smiled and 
said, addressing Yudhishthira: "No one 
need carry me. I can walk. Do not be 
anxious about me." 
They reached Kulinda, the kingdom of 
Subahu, on the Himalayas. They accepted 
the honors rendered to them by that king 
and rested there awhile. Later on, they 
went 
to 
the 
charming 
forest 
of 
Narayanasrama and halted there.  
One day, a breeze that blew from the 
northeast wafted a beautiful flower near 
Draupadi. Draupadi took it in her hands 
and was so charmed with its fragrance and 
beauty that she showed it rapturously to 
Bhima.  
"Come and see this flower. What a sweet 
fragrance! How charming! I shall hand 
this over to Yudhishthira. Bring some 
flowers of this kind. We should grow this 
plant in our Kamyaka forest." Draupadi 
ran to give the flower to Yudhishthira.  
Anxious to please his beloved Draupadi, 
Bhima went in quest of that plant. He 
went alone in the direction from which the 
fragrance seemed to be borne by the 
breeze, without wasting a thought on the 
wild beasts that crossed his path.  
He presently came to a garden of plantain 
trees at the foot of a mountain, and there 
he saw a huge monkey shining like 
blazing fire, which lay right across his 
path blocking it.  
He tried to frighten the animal out of his 
way by shouting at it. It only half opened 
its 
eyes 
lazily 
and 
drawled: 
"I 
am 
indisposed and so I am lying here. Why 
lid you wake me? You are a wise human 
being and I am mere animal. It is proper 
that the rational man should show mercy 
to animals as interior creatures. I am 
afraid you are ignorant of right and 
wrong. Who are you? Whither are you 
bound? It is not possible to go further 
along this mountain path which is the path 
of the gods. Men cannot cross this limit. 
Eat what you like of the fruits of this place 
and if you are wise, go back in peace."  
Bhima, unused to being taken so lightly, 
grew angry and shouted: "Who are you, 
yourself, you monkey, that indulges in 
such tall talk? I am a kshatriya hero, a 
descendant of the Kuru race and a son of 
Kunti. Know that I am the son of the 
Wind god. Now move away from the path 
or stop me at your peril." 
Hearing these words the monkey merely 
smiled and said: "I am, as you say, a 
monkey, but you will come to destruction 
if you try to force a way."  
Bhima said: "I do not want your advice 
and it is no concern of yours if I go to 
destruction. Get up and move out of the 
way or I will make you." 
The monkey replied: "I have no strength 
to stand up, being but a very old monkey. 
If you have to go at any cost, jump over 
me." 
Bhima said: "Nothing could be easier but 
the scriptures forbid it. Otherwise I should 
jump over you and the mountain in one 
bound, like Hanuman crossing the ocean." 
The monkey remarked as though in 
surprise: "O best of men, who is that 
Hanuman who crossed the ocean? If you 
know his story, enlighten me." 
Bhima roared and said: "Have you not 
heard of Hanuman, my elder brother, who 
crossed the ocean, a hundred yojanas in 
breadth, to seek and find Sita, the wife of 
Rama? I am equal to him in strength and 
heroism. Well, that is enough talk, now 
get up and make way and do not provoke 
me to do you some harm."  
The monkey answered: "O mighty hero, 
be patient. Be gentle as you are strong, 
and have mercy on the old and weak. I 
have no strength to rise up as I am 
decrepit with age. Since you have scruples 
in jumping over me, kindly move aside 
my tail and make a path for yourself." 
Proud of his immense strength, Bhima 
thought to pull the monkey out of the way 
by its tail. But, to his amazement he could 
not move it in the least, though he exerted 
all his strength.  
He set his jaws and strained every muscle 
till the very sinews cracked and he was 
covered with perspiration. But, still, could 
not move that tail the least, a little bit up 
or down or sideways. In shame, he bent 
down his head, and then asked in a 
chastened mood:  
"Who are you? Forgive me and reveal to 
me whether you are a Siddha, god or 
Gandharva." Bhima like most strong men, 
was all respect when he saw one stronger 
than himself, and spoke like a pupil 
addressing his master. 
Hanuman 
replied: 
"O 
mighty-armed 
Pandava, know that I am your brother, 
even that Hanuman, the son of the Wind 
god, whom you mentioned a little while 
ago. If you go on this path, which is the 
road to the spirit-world where the Yakshas 
and the Rakshasas abide, you will meet 
with danger and that is why I stop you. No 
man can go beyond this and live. But here 
is the stream with its depths where you 
can find the Saugandhika plant you came 
to seek."  
Bhima was transported with delight: "I 
count myself the most fortunate of men in 
that I have been blessed to meet my 
brother. I wish to see the form in which 
you crossed the ocean," and he prostrated 
before Hanuman. 
Hanuman smiled and began to increase 
the size of his body and stood forth firmly 
to the world like a mountain  seeming to 
fill the landscape.  
Bhima was thrilled at actually seeing that 
divine form of this elder brother, the mere 
description of which had till then filled 
him with wonder. He covered his eyes, 
unable to bear the dazzling light radiating 
from that figure.  
Hanuman said: "Bhima, in the presence of 
my enemies, my body can grow still 
more." 
And 
Hanuman 
contracted 
his 
body, 
resuming 
his 
former 
size. 
He 
tenderly embraced Bhimasena.  
Bhagavan Vyasa says that Bhima felt 
completely refreshed and became much 
stronger than before by the embrace of 
Hanuman.  
Hanuman said: "O hero, go to your abode. 
Think of me whenever you are in need. I 
felt the same delight when I embraced you 
that I had in times of yore when I was 
fortunate enough to touch the divine body 
of Sri Rama. Ask any boon that you like." 
Bhima said: "Blessed are the Pandavas for 
I have had the good fortune to see you. 
Inspired with your strength we are sure to 
conquer our enemies."  
Hanuman gave this parting blessing to his 
brother:  
"While you roar like a lion in the 
battlefield, my voice shall join yours and 
strike terror into the hearts of your 
enemies. I shall be present on the flag of 
the chariot of your brother Arjuna. You 
will be victorious." 
Hanuman pointed out to Bhima the stream 
nearby, where grew the Saugandhika 
flowers he had come to seek.  
This put Bhima at once in mind of 
Draupadi who was waiting for his return, 
and he collected the flowers and returned 
to her without delay. 
38. I AM NO CRANE 
ONCE the sage Markandeya came to see 
the Pandavas. Yudhishthira happened to 
talk of the virtues of the fair sex and said:  
"What greater wonder is there in this 
world than the patience and the chastity of 
woman? She gives birth to a child after 
cherishing it in her womb as dearer than 
life itself. She brings it into the world 
inpain and anxiety and thence forward her 
one 
thought 
is 
for 
its 
health 
and 
happiness. Large hearted and forgiving, a 
woman forgives and continues to love 
even a wicked husband who neglects and 
hates and subjects her to all sorts of 
miseries. How strange!" 
Hearing this Markandeya told him a 
sacred story. 
There was once a brahmana, named 
Kausika 
who 
observed 
his 
vow 
of 
brahmacharya. 
with 
great 
steadfastness 
and devotion.  
One day, he sat under a tree reciting the 
Vedas. A crane, perched on the top of the 
tree, defiled his head with its droppings. 
He looked up at it, and his angry look 
killed the bird and it fell down dead.  
The brahmana was pained when he saw 
the dead bird lying on the ground. 
How frightful it would be if wishes 
fulfilled themselves, if each hasty or angry 
wish took effect at once! How much there 
would be to regret or repent afterwards! It 
is lucky for us that wishes depend 
onoutward 
circumstances 
for 
accomplishment, since that saves us from 
much sin and sorrow.  
Kausika sorrowed that the evil thought 
that passed in his mind in a moment of 
anger had killed an innocent bird. Some 
time later, he went as usual to beg alms.  
He stood before the door of a house to 
receive his dole. The housewife was 
cleansing utensils at that time. Kausika 
waited in the hope that she would attend 
to him after her work was over.  
In the meantime the master of the house 
returned, tired and hungry, and the wife 
had to attend to his wants, wash and dry 
his feet and serve him with food.  
In this preoccupation she seemed to have 
forgotten the mendicant waiting outside. 
After her husband had been cared for and 
fed, she came out with alms to the 
mendicant.  
She said: "I am sorry to have kept you 
waiting long. Pardon me." 
Kausika, burning with anger, said: "Lady, 
you have made me wait for such a long 
time. This indifference is not fair."  
The woman told the brahmana: "Best of 
brahmanas, kindly do forgive me. I was 
serving my husband and hence the delay." 
The brahmana remarked: "It is right and 
proper to attend on the husband, but the 
brahmana also should not be disregarded. 
You seem an arrogant woman." 
She said: "Be not angry with me and 
remember that I kept you waiting only 
because 
I 
was 
dutifully 
serving 
my 
husband. I am no crane to be killed by a 
violent thought and your rage can do no 
harm to the woman who devotes herself to 
the service of her husband." 
The brahmana was taken aback. He 
wondered how the woman knew of the 
crane incident. 
She continued: "O great one, you do not 
know the secret of duty, and you are also 
not aware that anger is the greatest enemy 
that dwells in man. Forgive the delay in 
attending to you. Go to Mithila and be 
instructed in the secret of good life by 
Dharmavyadha living in that city."  
The brahmana was amazed. He said: "I 
deserve your just admonition and it will 
do me good. May all good attend you." 
With these words he went to Mithila. 
Kausika reached Mithila and looked for 
Dharmavyadha's 
residence, 
which 
he 
thought would be some lonely hermitage 
far from the noise and bustle of common 
life.  
He 
walked 
along 
magnificent 
roads 
between beautiful houses and gardens in 
that great city and finally reached a 
butcher's shop, in which was a man selling 
meat. His amazement was great when he 
learnt that this man was Dharmavyadha. 
The 
brahmana 
was 
shocked 
beyond 
measure and stood at a distance in disgust. 
The butcher suddenly rose from his seat, 
came to the brahmana and inquired: 
"Revered sir, are you well? Did that 
chaste brahmana lady send you to me?"  
The brahmana was stupefied. 
"Revered sir, I know why you have come. 
Let us go home," said the butcher and he 
took the brahmana to his house where he 
saw a happy family and was greatly struck 
by the devotion with which the butcher 
served his parents.  
Kausika took his lessons from that butcher 
on 
dharma, 
man's 
calling 
and 
duty. 
Afterwards, the brahmana returned to his 
house and began to tend his parents, a 
duty, which he had rather neglected 
before.  
The moral of this striking story of 
Dharmavyadha so skillfully woven by 
Vedavyasa into the Mahabharata, is the 
same as the teaching of the Gita. Man 
reaches perfection by the honest pursuit of 
whatever calling falls to his lot in life, and 
that this is really worship of God who 
created and pervades all. (Bhagavad Gita, 
XVIII, 45-46)  
The occupation may be one he is born to 
in society or it may have been forced on 
him by circumstances or be may have 
taken it up by choice. But what really 
matters is the spirit of sincerity and 
faithfulness with which be does his life's 
work. 
Vedavyasa emphasizes this great truth by 
making a scholarly brahmana, who did not 
know it, learn it from a butcher, who lived 
it in his humble and despised life. 
39. THE WICKED ARE NEVER 
SATISFIED 
MANY brahmanas visited the Pandavas 
during their exile. And one such, returning 
to Hastinapura, went to see Dhritarashtra, 
who received him with due honor.  
The brahmana told him how the Pandavas, 
born princes, were, by unkind destiny, at 
the mercy of the wind and the sun and 
suffered great privations.  
Dhritarashtra was probably sorry to hear 
this. But what troubled him most were the 
consequences to his own sons. Could 
Yudhishthira continue to hold the justly 
wrathful Bhima in check?  
Dhritarashtra feared that the anger of the 
Pandavas, long pent up, might one day 
break its bounds and overflow in a 
devastating flood.  
The 
king 
anxiously 
pondered 
thus: 
"Arjuna and Bhima will certainly try to 
punish us. Sakuni, Karna, Duryodhana 
and 
the 
short-sighted 
Duhsasana 
are 
perched precariously up a tree in search of 
a honeycomb while below is the abyss of 
Bhima's anger yawning to receive them to 
their destruction." 
The blind king pursued his thought: "Alas, 
why 
did 
we 
become 
a 
prey 
to 
covetousness? It is not as though poverty 
drove us to it! Why did we take to the 
path of injustice? Instead of enjoying our 
boundless 
wealth 
in 
contentment 
we 
succumbed 
to 
lust 
of 
power 
and 
possession and coveted what was not ours. 
Wrong cannot but yield its bitter harvest! 
Arjuna has returned from heaven with 
divine weapons. What could tempt one 
back to earth from heaven but the craving 
for vengeance? And we have earned it!" 
These thoughts would haunt and give him 
no peace. 
Though Dhritarashtra was thus worried, 
Sakuni, Karna and Duryodhana were 
giddily happy and found much pleasure in 
exulting congratulation of one another on 
their prosperity.  
Karna and Sakuni said to Duryodhana: 
"The kingdom which was in the hands of 
Yudhishthira has become ours. We need 
no longer burn with jealousy."  
Duryodhana replied: "O Karna, all that is 
true, but would it not be a joy of joys to 
see with my own eyes the sufferings of 
the Pandavas and bring their sorrow to a 
climax by a display of our happiness? The 
only way to perfect our happiness is to go 
to the forest and see the distress of the 
Pandavas, 
but 
my 
father 
will 
refuse 
permission," and Duryodhana shed tears 
at his father's cruelty in denying him this 
pleasure. 
He said again: "The king fears the 
Pandavas, as he thinks that they are 
endowed with the power of austerities. He 
forbids us to go to the forest and meet 
them, lest danger should befall us. But I 
tell you, all we have done so far is labor 
lost, without a sight of the sufferings of 
Draupadi, Bhima and Arjuna in the forest. 
This life of idle ease is torment to me 
without that great joy. Sakuni and yourself 
must seek a way of obtaining the king's 
consent for us to go to the forest and see 
the Pandavas in their misery." 
Early 
next 
morning, 
Karna 
went 
to 
Duryodhana with a cheerful face and 
announced that he had found a way out of 
the difficulty.  
He said: "What do you think of going to 
our ranches at Dwaitavana for the annual 
stock-taking of the cows? The king 
certainly cannot object to that." Sakuni 
and Duryodhana applauded this bright 
idea and sent the leader of the cowherds to 
the king to secure his permission. 
But the king would not assent. He said: 
"Hunting 
is 
indeed 
beneficial 
to 
the 
princes. It is also desirable to take stock of 
the cows. But I learn that the Pandavas are 
dwelling in that forest. It is not advisable 
for you to go there. I cannot agree to send 
you to a place near the abode of Bhima 
and Arjuna while there is still occasion for 
anger and strife."  
Duryodhana said: "We shall not go near 
them. On the contrary we shall be very 
careful 
and 
avoid 
them." 
The 
king 
answered: 
"However careful you may be, there is 
danger in mere nearness. Also, it is not 
right to intrude on the sorrows of the 
Pandavas in their forest life. Anyone of 
your soldiers might trespass and give 
offence, which may lead to trouble. 
Someone else can go in your stead to 
count the cattle."  
Sakuni said: "O king, Yudhishthira knows 
and follows the path of dharma. He has 
given his promise in the open assembly 
and the Pandavas will follow his bidding. 
The sons of Kunti will not show any 
enmity 
towards 
us. 
Do 
not 
oppose 
Duryodhana who is fond of hunting. Let 
him return after taking stock of the cows. I 
shall also accompany him and see to it 
that none of us go anywhere near the 
Pandavas." 
The king, over-persuaded as usual, said: 
"Well, please yourselves." A heart full of 
hate can know no contentment. Hate is a 
cruel fire, which extorts the fuel, on which 
it lives and grows. 
40. DURYODHANA DISGRACED 
THE Kauravas reached Dwaitavana with a 
great 
army 
and 
many 
followers. 
Duryodhana 
and 
Karna 
went 
with 
unconcealed joy at the very thought of 
being able to gloat on the sad plight of the 
Pandavas.  
They themselves camped in luxurious rest 
houses in a place four miles off the abode 
of the Pandavas. They inspected the herds 
of cows and took stock of them.  
After counting the cows, bulls and calves, 
they enjoyed the dance, the hunt, the 
sylvan sports and other entertainment’s 
arranged for them. 
While hunting, Duryodhana and his party 
reached an attractive pond near the 
hermitage of the Pandavas and ordered a 
camp to be put on its bank.  
Chitrasena, the king of the Gandharvas, 
and his attendants had already encamped 
in the neighborhood of the pool and they 
prevented Duryodhana's men from putting 
up their camp.  
They 
returned 
to 
Duryodhana 
and 
represented that some petty prince who 
was there with his followers was giving 
them trouble. 
Duryodhana 
was 
annoyed 
at 
this 
presumption and directed his men to turn 
the Gandharva prince out and put up the 
tents. The attendants returned to the lake 
and tried to carry out their orders but 
found the Gandharvas too many for them 
and had to retreat in precipitation. 
When Duryodhana came to know of this, 
he grew very angry and with a large army 
marched to destroy the audacious enemies 
who had dared to resist his pleasure. A 
great 
fight 
ensued 
between 
the 
Gandharvas and Duryodhana's army.  
At first the fight went in favor of the 
Kauravas. But the tables were quickly 
turned when Chitrasena, the king of the 
Gandharvas, rallied his troops and began 
using his magic weapons.  
Karna and the other Kaurava heroes lost 
their chariots and weapons and had to 
retreat 
in 
haste 
and 
ignominy. 
Duryodhana 
alone 
remained 
in 
the 
battlefield but he was soon seized by 
Chitrasena, who placed him in his chariot 
bound hand and foot, and blew his conch 
in token of victory.  
The 
Gandharvas 
took 
many 
of 
the 
prominent Kauravas captive. The Kaurava 
army fled in all directions and some of the 
fugitives took refuge in the hermitage of 
the Pandavas. 
Bhima heard the news of Duryodhana's 
defeat 
and 
capture 
with 
delight 
and 
amusement. 
He 
said 
to 
Yudhishthira: 
"These Gandharvas have done our job for 
us. Duryodhana, who must have come 
here to mock at us, has got what he 
deserved. 
I 
feel 
like 
thanking 
our 
Gandharva friend!"  
But Yudhishthira reproved him: "Dear 
brother, this is not the time for you to 
rejoice. The Kauravas are our kith and kin 
and their humiliation, at the hands of 
strangers, is ours. We cannot hold back 
and take this lying down. We must rescue 
them." 
Bhima did not think this very reasonable. 
He said: "Why should we save this sinner 
who tried to burn us alive in the wax 
house? Why should you feel sorry for the 
fellow who poisoned my food, bound me 
hand and foot and wanted to drown me in 
the river? What brotherly feeling can we 
really have towards these vile wretches 
who hauled Draupadi by the hair to 
theassembly and disgraced her?"  
At that moment a cry of agony from 
Duryodhana reached them faintly from the 
distance and Yudhishthira, greatly moved, 
overruled Bhima's objection and bade his 
brothers go to the rescue of the Kauravas.  
Obedient to his behest, Bhima and Arjuna 
rallied the routed Kaurava forces and 
offered battle to the Gandharvas. But 
Chitrasena had no wish to fight with the 
Pandavas and at their approach, released 
Duryodhana 
and 
the 
other 
prisoners 
saying that all he wanted was to teach a 
lesson to these arrogant Kauravas.  
The dishonored Kauravas returned in 
haste to Hastinapura, with Karna, who, 
having been, driven off the battlefield, 
joined them on the way. 
Duryodhana, 
in 
great 
shame 
and 
dejection, felt it would have been far 
better if be had been killed by Chitrasena 
and announced his wish to fast unto death.  
He said to Duhsasana: "Be crowned and 
rule the kingdom. I can no longer continue 
to live after having become a laughing 
stock to my enemies." 
Duhsasana protested his unworthiness to 
be king and caught hold of his brother's 
feet and wept. Karna could not bear the 
sight of the brother's sorrow. 
Karna said: "This does not befit heroes of 
the Kuru race. What is the use of just 
collapsing under sorrow? It will but make 
your 
enemies 
happy. 
Look 
at 
the 
Pandavas. They have not taken to fasts in 
spite of the disgrace they have suffered."  
Sakuni interposed and said: "Listen to 
Karna's words. Why do you say that you 
would give up your life when the kingdom 
seized from the Pandavas is yours to 
enjoy? Fasting serves no purpose, for if 
you really repent of what you have done 
till now, you should make friends with the 
Pandavas 
and 
give 
them 
back 
their 
kingdom."  
When Duryodhana heard this speech, his 
evil 
nature 
regained 
ascendancy, 
for 
giving back the kingdom to the Pandavas 
was to him a hundred times worse than 
defeat or disgrace. He shouted: "I shall 
conquer the Pandavas." 
Karna said: "That is the way for a king to 
talk." 
And he added: "What sense is there in 
dying? You can do something worthwhile 
only if you are alive."  
While returning home, Karna said: "I 
swear to you by all that is holy that, when 
the stipulated period of thirteen years is 
over, I will kill Arjuna in battle." And 
then he touched his sword in token of the 
oath. 
41. SRI KRISHNA'S HUNGER 
WHILE the Pandavas were dwelling in 
the forest, Duryodhana celebrated a great 
sacrifice with much pomp and splendor.  
He wanted to perform the Rajasuya 
sacrifice, but the brahmanas told him that 
he could not do that while Yudhishthira 
and Dhritarashtra were alive and advised 
him to perform the sacrifice known as the 
Vaishnava instead. 
He accepted this advice and celebrated the 
Vaishnava with great splendor. But when 
the ceremony was over, the citizens began 
to 
talk 
among 
themselves 
that 
Duryodhana's sacrifice had not come up to 
even a sixteenth part of Yudhishthira's 
Rajasuya in magnificence.  
The friends of Duryodhana, on the other 
hand, praised him and the sacrifice he had 
celebrated 
and 
likened 
it 
to 
those 
performed by Yayati, Mandhata, Bharata 
and others.  
Court flatterers were not sparing with 
their praise. Karna told Duryodhana that 
his Rajasuya had been only postponed till 
the Pandavas should be defeated and slain 
in battle and repeated that his part would 
be the slaying of Arjuna.  
"Till I have slain Arjuna," said he, "I shall 
not take meat or wine, nor will I refuse the 
prayer of anyone who asks me for 
anything." Such was the solemn vow 
taken by Karna in the assembly. 
The sons of Dhritarashtra were delighted 
to hear this vow of the great hero Karna 
and shouted in joy. They felt as if the 
Pandavas had been slain already. 
Spies conveyed to the Pandavas in the 
forest the news of the oath taken by 
Karna. 
Yudhishthira 
was 
greatly 
concerned, for he had a great opinion of 
Karna's prowess.  
Karna had been born with divine armor 
and was undoubtedly a mighty hero. One 
morning, 
just 
before 
the 
hour 
of 
awakening, Yudhishthira had a dream.  
Many of our dreams come either in the 
beginning or at the end of our sleep. He 
dreamt that the wild beasts of the forest 
came and appealed to him piteously not to 
destroy them altogether, but to move on to 
some other forest.  
Duryodhana felt sure that the Pandavas, 
who themselves lived from hand to mouth 
in the forest, would be unable to feed or 
entertain the sage and his following, and 
would incur some dreadful curse from that 
too 
hasty 
visitor 
for 
their 
want 
of 
hospitality. This would give him greater 
joy than any benefit he could have asked 
for himself when the sage offered a boon. 
Durvasa went with his disciples to the 
Pandavas as was desired by Duryodhana, 
as the latter were resting after their 
midday meal. 
The brothers welcomed the sage, saluted 
and honored him. Then the sage said: "We 
shall be back soon. Our meals must be 
ready then, for we are hungry," and 
hurried off with his disciples to the river.  
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
austerities 
of 
Yudhishthira at the beginning of their stay 
in the forest, the Sun god had given him 
the Akshayapatra, a wonderful vessel that 
held a never-failing supply of food.  
In making the gift, the god had said, 
"Through this I shall place at your 
disposal for twelve years as much food as 
is required for your daily consumption.  
Not till everyone has been served and 
Draupadi herself has taken her share will 
the vessel become empty for the day." 
Accordingly, the brahmanas and other 
guests would be served first. Afterwards 
the Pandava brothers would take their 
meals. Finally, Draupadi would have her 
share.  
When Durvasa reached the place, all of 
them, including Draupadi, had eaten their 
meals and so the vessel was empty and 
denuded of its power for the day.  
Draupadi 
was 
greatly 
troubled 
and 
perfectly at a loss to find food when the 
sage and his disciples should return after 
their ablutions. In the kitchen, she prayed 
earnestly to Sri Krishna to come to her aid 
in this hopeless predicament and deliver 
her from the wrath of the sage. 
At once Sri Krishna appeared before her. 
"I am very hungry," he said, "bring 
without delay something to eat and we 
shall speak of other things afterwards."  
Here was a pretty pass. It looked as 
though the ally from whom she hoped for 
relief had gone over to the foe! She cried 
out in great confusion: "Alas! Why do you 
try me thus, O Krishna? The power of the 
vessel given by the Sun is exhausted for 
the day. And the sage Durvasa has come. 
What shall I do? The sage and his 
disciples will soon be here and as though 
this were not enough, you have also come 
at this juncture saying that you are 
hungry." 
Sri Krishna said: "I am terribly hungry 
and want food, not excuses. Fetch the 
vessel and let me see for myself." 
Draupadi brought it to him. A tiny bit of 
cooked vegetable and a grain of rice were 
sticking to the rim of the vessel.  
Sri Krishna ate them with satisfaction, 
accepting them as Sri Hari, the Soul of the 
Universe. Draupadi was filled with shame 
at her slovenliness in not having cleaned 
the vessel free of all remnants. A bit had 
been left which had been partaken by 
Vasudeva!  
Sri 
Krishna 
seemed 
replete 
with 
satisfaction after eating his solitary grain 
and calling Bhima, told him to go to the 
river and intimate to the revered sage that 
food was ready and waiting for them. 
Bhimasena, greatly puzzled, but full of 
faith in Sri Krishna, hastened to the river 
where Durvasa and his followers were 
bathing.  
They were in great surprise to find that 
their ravenous hunger had given place to a 
pleased 
satiety. 
They 
had 
all 
the 
comfortable cheerfulness of people who 
had feasted well.  
The disciples told the sage: "We have 
come here after asking Yudhishthira to 
prepare food for us, but we feel well-fed 
and full and cannot eat anything more."  
Durvasa knew what it was and he told 
Bhima: "We have taken our meals. Tell 
Yudhishthira to forgive us." Then the 
party went away.  
The explanation is that as the whole 
universe is contained in Sri Krishna, his 
satisfaction with a single grain of rice 
satisfied for the time the hunger of all 
beings including the sage. 
42. THE ENCHANTED POOL 
THE stipulated period of twelve years was 
drawing to a close.  
One day, a deer was rubbing itself against 
a poor brahmana's fire-kindling mortar 
and as it turned to go, the mortar got 
entangled in its horns and the affrighted 
animal fled wildly with it into the forest.  
In those days matches were unknown and 
fire was kindled with pieces of wood by 
mechanical friction.  
"Alas! The deer is running away with my 
fire-kindler. How can I perform the fire 
sacrifice?" 
shouted the brahmana and 
rushed towards the Pandavas for help in 
his extremity.  
The Pandavas pursued the animal but it 
was a magic deer, which sped in great 
leaps and bounds, decoying the Pandavas 
far into the forest and then disappeared. 
Worn 
out 
by 
the 
futile 
chase, 
the 
Pandavas sat in great dejection under a 
banyan tree.  
Nakula sighed: "We cannot render even 
this trifling service to the brahmana. How 
we have degenerated!" said he sadly.  
Bhima said: "Quite so. When Draupadi 
was dragged into the assembly, we should 
have killed those wretches. Is it not 
because we did not do so that we have had 
to suffer all these sorrows?" and he looked 
at Arjuna sadly.  
Arjuna agreed. "I bore in silence the 
vulgar and insulting brag of that son of the 
charioteer, doing nothing. So we have 
deservedly fallen into this pitiable state." 
Yudhishthira noticed with sorrow that all 
of them had lost their cheerfulness and 
courage. He thought they would be more 
cheerful with something to do. He was 
tormented with thirst and so he said to 
Nakula: "Brother, climb that tree and see 
whether there is any pool or river nearby." 
Nakula climbed the tree, looked around 
and said: "At a little distance I see water 
plants and cranes. There must certainly be 
water there." 
Yudhishthira sent him to fetch some to 
drink.  
Nakula was glad when he got to the place 
and saw there was a pool. He was very 
thirsty 
himself 
and 
so 
thought 
of 
quenching his thirst first before taking 
water in his quiver for his brother. But no 
sooner did he dip his hand in the 
transparent water than he heard a voice, 
which said: 
"Do not be rash. This pool belongs to me. 
O son of Madri, answer my questions and 
then drink the water."  
Nakula was surprised, but carried away by 
his intense thirst and heedless of the 
warning, he drank the water. At once, 
overcome by irresistible drowsiness, he 
fell down, to all appearance dead. 
Surprised that Nakula had not returned, 
Yudhishthira sent Sahadeva to see what 
the matter was.  When Sahadeva reached 
the pool and saw his brother lying on the 
ground, he wondered whether any harm 
had come to him. But before looking into 
the matter further, rushed irresistibly to 
the water to quench his burning thirst.  
The voice was heard again: "O Sahadeva, 
this is my pool. Answer my questions and 
then only may you quench your thirst." 
Like Nakula, Sahadeva also did not heed 
the warning. He drank the water and at 
once dropped down. 
Puzzled and worried that Sahadeva also 
did not return, Yudhishthira sent Arjuna to 
see whether the brothers had met with any 
danger. "And bring water," he added, for 
he was very thirsty. 
Arjuna went swiftly. He saw both his 
brothers lying dead near the pool. He was 
shocked at the sight and felt that they 
must have been killed by some lurking 
foe.  
Though 
heart-broken 
with 
grief 
and 
burning with the desire for revenge, he 
felt all feelings submerged in a monstrous 
thirst, which irresistibly impelled him to 
the fatal pool. Again, a voice was heard: 
"Answer my question before you drink the 
water. This pool is mine. If you disobey 
me, you will follow your brothers." 
Arjuna's anger knew no bounds. He cried: 
"Who are you? Come and stand up to me, 
and I will kill you," and he shot keen-
edged arrows in the direction of the voice. 
The invisible being laughed in scorn: 
"Your arrows do but wound the air. 
Answer my questions and then you can 
satisfy your thirst. If you drink the water 
without doing so, you will die."  
Greatly vexed, Arjuna made up his mind 
to seek out and grapple with this elusive 
foe. But first he had to quench his terrible 
thirst. Yes, thirst was the enemy he must 
kill first. So he drank the water and also 
fell down dead.  
After anxious waiting Yudhishthira turned 
to Bhima: "Dear brother, Arjuna, the great 
hero, has also not yet returned. Something 
terrible 
must 
have 
happened 
to 
our 
brothers, for our stars are bad. Please seek 
them out and be quick about it. Also bring 
water, for I die of thirst." Bhima, racked 
with anxiety, hurried away without a 
word.  
His grief and rage can be imagined when 
he saw his three brothers lying there dead. 
He thought: "This is certainly the work of 
the Yakshas. I will hunt them down and 
kill them. But O! I am so thirsty, I shall 
first drink water the better to fight them." 
And then he descended into the pool. 
The voice shouted: "Bhimasena, beware. 
You may drink only after answering my 
questions. You will die if you disregard 
my words." 
"Who are you to dictate to me?" cried 
Bhima, and he drank the water avidly, 
glaring around in defiance. And as he did 
so, his great strength seemed to slip from 
him like a garment. And he also fell dead 
among his brothers. 
Alone, Yudhishthira wailed full of anxiety 
and thirst. "Have they been subjected to a 
curse or are they wandering about in the 
forest in a vain search for water or have 
they fainted or died of thirst?"  
Unable to bear these thoughts  and driven 
desperate by an overpowering thirst, he 
started out to look for his brothers and the 
pool.  
Yudhishthira proceeded in the direction 
his brothers had taken through tracts 
infested with wild boar and abounding in 
spotted 
dear and huge forest birds. 
Presently he came upon a beautiful green 
meadow, girdling a pool of pellucid water, 
nectar to his eyes.  
But when he saw his brothers lying there 
like sacred flagpoles thrown pell-mell 
after a festival, unable to restrain his grief, 
he lifted his voice and wept. He stroked 
the faces of Bhima and Arjuna as they lay 
so still and silent there and mourned:  
"Was this to be the end of all our vows? 
Just when our exile is about to end, you 
have been snatched away. Even the gods 
have forsaken me in my misfortune!" 
As he looked at their mighty limbs, now 
so helpless, he sadly wondered who could 
have been powerful enough to kill them. 
Brokenly, he reflected: "Surely my heart 
must be made of steel not to break even 
after seeing Nakula and Sahadeva dead. 
For what purpose should I continue to live 
in this world?"  
Then a sense of mystery overcame him, 
for this could be no ordinary occurrence. 
The world held no warriors who could 
overcome his brothers. Besides, there 
were no wounds on their bodies which 
could have let out life and their faces were 
faces of men who slept in peace and not of 
those who died in wrath.  
There was also no trace of the footprints 
of an enemy. There was surely some 
magic about it. Or, could it be a trick 
played by Duryodhana? Might he not 
have 
poisoned 
the 
water? 
Then 
Yudhishthira also descended into the pool, 
in his turn drawn to the water by a 
consuming thirst.  
At once the voice without form warned as 
before: "Your brothers died because they 
did not heed my words. Do not follow 
them. Answer my questions first and then 
quench your thirst. This pool is mine." 
Yudhishthira knew that these could be 
none other than the words of a Yaksha 
and guessed what had happened to his 
brothers. He saw a possible way of 
redeeming the situation. 
He said to the bodiless voice: "Please ask 
your questions." The voice put questions 
rapidly one after another. 
The Yaksha asked: "What makes sun 
shine every day?"  
Yudhishthira 
replied: 
"The 
power 
of 
Brahman."  
The Yaksha asked: "What rescues man in 
danger?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Courage is man's 
salvation in danger." 
The Yaksha asked: "By the study of which 
science does man become wise?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Not by studying 
any sastra does man become wise. It is by 
association with the great in wisdom that 
he gets wisdom." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is more nobly 
sustaining than the earth?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "The mother who 
brings up the children she has borne is 
nobler and more sustaining than the 
earth." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is higher than 
the sky?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "The father." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is fleeter than 
wind?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Mind." 
The 
Yaksha 
asked: 
"What 
is 
more 
blighted than withered straw?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "A sorrow-stricken 
heart." 
The Yaksha asked: "What befriends a 
traveller?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Learning." 
The Yaksha asked: "Who is the friend of 
one who stays at home?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "The wife." 
The Yaksha asked: "Who accompanies a 
man in death?" 
Yudhishthira 
replied: 
"Dharma. 
That 
alone accompanies the soul in its solitary 
journey after death." 
The Yaksha asked: "Which is the biggest 
vessel?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "The earth, which 
contains all within itself is the greatest 
vessel." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is happiness?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Happiness is the 
result of good conduct." 
The 
Yaksha 
asked: 
"What 
is 
that, 
abandoning which man becomes loved by 
all?" 
Yudhishthira 
replied: 
"Pride, 
for 
abandoning that man will be loved by all." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is the loss 
which yields joy and not sorrow?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Anger, giving it up, 
we will no longer subject to sorrow." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is that, by 
giving up which, man becomes rich?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Desire, getting rid 
of it, man becomes wealthy." 
The Yaksha asked: "What makes one a 
real brahmana? Is it birth, good conduct or 
learning? Answer decisively." 
Yudhishthira replied: "Birth and learning 
do not make one a brahmana. Good 
conduct alone does. However learned a 
person may be he will not be a brahmana 
if he is a slave to bad habits. Even though 
he may be learned in the four Vedas, a 
man of bad conduct falls to a lower class." 
The Yaksha asked: "What is the greatest 
wonder in the world?" 
Yudhishthira replied: "Every day, men see 
creatures depart to Yama's abode and yet, 
those who remain seek to live forever. 
This verily is the greatest wonder." 
Thus, the Yaksha posed many questions 
and Yudhishthira answered them all. 
In the end the Yaksha asked: "O king, one 
of your dead brothers can now be revived. 
Whom do you want revived? He shall 
come back to life." 
Yudhishthira thought for a moment and 
then 
replied: 
"May 
the 
cloud-
complexioned, lotus-eyed, broad-chested 
and long-armed Nakula, lying like a fallen 
ebony tree, arise."  
The Yaksha was pleased at this and asked 
Yudhishthira: 
"Why 
did 
you 
choose 
Nakula in preference to Bhima who has 
the 
strength 
of 
sixteen 
thousand 
elephants? I have heard that Bhima is 
most dear to you. And why not Arjuna, 
whose prowess in arms is your protection? 
Tell me why you chose Nakula rather than 
either of these two."  
Yudhishthira replied: "O Yaksha, dharma 
is the only shield of man and not Bhima or 
Arjuna. If dharma is set at naught, man 
will be ruined. Kunti and Madri were the 
two wives of my father. I am surviving, a 
son of Kunti, and so, she is not completely 
bereaved. In order that the scales of 
justice may be even, I ask that Madri's son 
Nakula may revive." The Yaksha was 
pleased 
with 
Yudhishthira's 
impartiality 
and granted that all his brothers would 
come back to life. 
It was Yama, the Lord of Death, who had 
taken the form of the deer and the Yaksha 
so that he might see his son Yudhishthira 
and test him. He embraced Yudhishthira 
and blessed him. 
Yama said: "Only a few days remain to 
complete the stipulated period of your 
exile in the forest. The thirteenth year will 
also pass by. None of your enemies will 
be able to discover you. You will 
successfully fulfil your undertaking," and 
saying this he disappeared.  
The Pandavas had, no doubt, to pass 
through all sorts of troubles during their 
exile, 
but 
the 
gains 
too 
were 
not 
inconsiderable. It was a period of hard 
discipline 
and 
searching 
probation 
through which they emerged stronger and 
nobler men.  
Arjuna returned from tapas with divine 
weapons and strengthened by contact with 
Indra. Bhima also met his elder brother 
Hanuman 
near 
the 
lake 
where 
the 
Saugandhika flowers bloomed and got 
tenfold strength from his embrace. Having 
met, at the enchanted pool, his father 
Yama, the Lord of Dharma, Yudhishthira 
shone with tenfold lustre.  
"The minds of those who listen to the 
sacred story of Yudhishthira's meeting 
with his father, will never go after evil. 
They will never seek to create quarrels 
among friends or covet the wealth of 
others. They will never fall victims to lust. 
They will never be unduly attached to 
transitory 
things." 
Thus 
said 
Vaisampayana to Janamejaya as he related 
this story of the Yaksha. May the same 
good attend the readers of this story as 
retold by us. 
43. DOMESTIC SERVICE 
"O 
BRAHMANAS, 
we 
have 
been 
deceived by the sons of Dhritarashtra, 
cheated out of our kingdom and reduced 
to poverty. Still we have passed these 
years cheerfully with joy in the forest. The 
thirteenth year of exile has come, and with 
it the time for us to part from you. For we 
have to spend the next twelve months 
undiscovered by the spies of Duryodhana. 
God knows when the day will dawn which 
will see us together again, without fear or 
concealment. Now, bless us before we go. 
And may we escape the notice of those 
who may wish to betray us to the sons of 
Dhritarashtra, either through fear or hope 
of reward."  
So spoke Yudhishthira to the brahmanas 
who were living with the Pandavas till 
then. His voice shook with emotion as he 
spoke these words. 
Dhaumya consoled him. He said: "Parting, 
is hard, and the dangers are many and 
great. But you are too wise and learned to 
be shaken or daunted. You must disguise 
yourselves. Indra, the Lord of gods, when 
pested by the demons, disguised himself 
as a brahmana and lived unknown in the 
country of Nishadha. Safely concealed 
thus, he managed to destroy his enemies. 
You must also do likewise. Did not 
Mahavishnu, the Lord of the Universe, 
become a child in the womb of Aditi, 
suffer human birth, and take away from 
Emperor 
Bali 
his 
kingdom 
for 
the 
salvation of the world? Did not Lord 
Narayana, the refuge of men, enter into 
the weapon of Indra to defeat Vritra, the 
asura king? Did not the Fire god hide 
himself in the waters for the sake of the 
gods? Does not the moon keep out of 
sight every day? Did not Lord Vishnu, the 
all-pervading God, descend as the son of 
Dasaratha and spend long years, suffering 
many sorrows for the sake of killing 
Ravana? The greatest souls in the past 
have 
sanctified 
disguise 
for 
a 
good 
purpose. You will, likewise, conquer your 
enemies and win prosperity."  
Yudhishthira took leave of the brahmanas 
and gave the members of his retinue leave 
to go home. The Pandavas retired to a 
secluded spot in the forest and discussed 
their future line of action. Yudhishthira 
sadly 
asked 
Arjuna: 
"You 
are 
well 
conversant with the ways of the world. 
Where would it be best for us to spend the 
thirteenth year?" 
Arjuna replied:  "O great king, you know 
Yama, the Lord of Death, has blessed us. 
We can easily pass the twelve months 
together without being discovered. There 
are many charming states for us to choose 
from for our sojourn, states like Panchala, 
Matsya, 
Salva, 
Videha, 
Bahlika, 
Dasharna, 
Surasena, 
Kalinga, 
and 
Magadha. It is, of course, for you to 
choose. But if I may venture an opinion, 
the Matsya country of king Virata is the 
best, prosperous and charming as it is." 
Yudhishthira answered: "Virata, the king 
of Matsya, is very strong and he loves us 
much. He is of mature judgment and is 
devoted to the practice of virtue. He will 
not be won over or frightened by 
Duryodhana. I agree that it would be best 
to live incognito in Virata's kingdom." 
Arjuna said: "Well then, O king, what 
work would you seek in the court of 
Virata?" 
When he asked this question, Arjuna was 
full 
of 
sorrow 
at 
the 
thought 
of 
Yudhishthira, the great and guileless king, 
who 
had 
performed 
the 
Rajasuya 
sacrifice, having to disguise himself and 
take service. 
Yudhishthira answered: "I am thinking of 
asking Virata to take me in his service as a 
courtier. I could delight him with my 
conversation and my dexterity at dice. I 
shall take the garb of a sanyasin and shall 
keep him agreeably engaged by my skill 
in 
reading 
omens 
and 
knowledge 
ofastrology as well as of the Vedas, 
Vedangas, 
ethics, 
politics 
and 
other 
sciences. I shall have to be careful of 
course, but be not anxious about me. I 
shall tell him that I was an intimate friend 
of Yudhishthira and learnt these things 
while I was privileged to be with him. O 
Bhima, 
what 
works 
will 
you, 
who 
conquered and slew Baka and Hidimba, 
take up under Virata? You saved us by 
killing Jatasura. Valor and strength are 
over-flowing from you. What disguise can 
hide your mighty personality and enable 
you to live unknown in the country of 
Mastya?" Yudhishthira was in tears as he 
put this question to Bhima. 
Bhima laughingly replied:  "O king, I 
think of taking service as a cook in the 
court of Virata. You know that I have a 
great appetite and that I am also an expert 
in cooking. I shall please Virata by 
preparing such dainty food as he has never 
tasted. I shall chop the trees of the forest 
and bring heaps of fuel. I shall also delight 
the king by contending with and defeating 
the wrestlers who come to his court."  
This made Yudhishthira anxious for he 
feared that danger might befall them if 
Bhima 
engaged 
himself 
in 
wrestling 
bouts. At once Bhima spoke thus to calm 
his fears:  
"I shall not kill anyone. I may give a bad 
jolt to any wrestler who deserves it but I 
shall not kill anyone. I shall restrain mad 
bulls, buffaloes and other wild animals 
and thus entertain king Virata." 
Afterwards 
Yudhishthira 
addressed 
Arjuna: "What profession do you propose 
to take up? How can you hide your 
towering valor?" 
When he asked this question Yudhishthira 
could not restrain him from narrating the 
brilliant exploits of Arjuna. He spoke of 
his brother's glory in twenty verses. Well, 
who deserves praise if not Arjuna? 
Arjuna replied: "Revered brother, I shall 
hide myself in the guise of a eunuch and 
serve the ladies of the court. I shall hide 
under a jacket the scars on my arms made 
by the constant chafing of the bowstring. 
When 
I 
rejected 
Urvasi's 
amorous 
overtures on the ground that she was like 
a mother unto me, she cursed me with loss 
of manhood. But through Indra's grace the 
curse would hold good only for a year, 
and the time would be mine to choose. I 
shall serve out that year of loss of 
manhood now. Wearing bangles made of 
white conchs, braiding my hair like a 
woman, and clothing myself in female 
attire, I shall engage myself in menial 
work in the inner apartments of Virata's 
queen. I shall teach the women singing 
and dancing. And I shall seek service 
saying that I used to serve Draupadi in 
Yudhishthira's court." Saying this, Arjuna 
turned to Draupadi and smiled. 
Yudhishthira was in tears. "Alas! Have the 
fates decreed that he, who is the equal of 
Sri Krishna himself in fame and valor, a 
scion of Bharata's line, who stands high 
like the great golden Mount Meru, must 
go and seek employment of Virata as a 
eunuch in the queen's inner apartments?" 
he said brokenly. 
Yudhishthira then turned to Nakula and 
asked him what work he would engage in 
and, as he thought of Madri, the mother of 
Nakula, tears rolled down his eyes. 
Nakula replied: "I shall work in King 
Virata's stables. My mind delights in 
training and looking after horses. For I 
know the heart of horses and have 
knowledge of their ailments and cure. I 
can not only ride and break horses but 
also harness and drive them in a chariot. I 
shall say that I had looked after the horses 
of the Pandavas and I have no doubt 
Virata will take me in his service." 
Yudhishthira asked Sahadeva: "You, with 
the intelligence of Brihaspati, the priest 
and the preceptor of the gods, and the 
knowledge of Sukra, the teacher of the 
asuras, what work will you take up?"  
Sahadeva replied: "Let Nakula look after 
horses. I shall tend the cows. I shall guard 
Virata's cattle from the ravages of disease 
and the attacks of wild beasts." 
"O Draupadi," but Yudhishthira could not 
find words to ask her what she proposed 
to do. She was dearer to him than life 
itself, 
worthy 
of 
all 
reverence 
and 
protection, and it seemed sacrilege to talk 
of service. She was a princess, the 
daughter of a king, nobly born, tenderly 
nurtured. Yudhishthira felt choked by 
shame and despair.  
Draupadi saw his grief and spoke these 
brave words: "O best of kings, do not 
grieve or suffer anxiety on my account. I 
shall be a sairandhri in the court of the 
queen of Virata, the companion and 
attendant of the princess. I shall preserve 
my freedom and chastity, for the attendant 
and companion of a princess has this right 
and can exercise it. I shall pass my days in 
such light tasks as braiding the hair and 
entertaining the women of the court with 
small talk. I shall represent that I had thus 
served 
princess 
Draupadi 
in 
Yudhishthira's court and seek employment 
from the queen. Thus shall I remain 
unknown to others." 
Yudhishthira praised Draupadi's courage 
and said: "O auspicious one, you speak as 
befits one of your family." 
When 
the 
Pandavas 
thus 
decided, 
Dhaumya blessed them and advised them 
thus: "Those who are engaged in service 
under a king should always be vigilant. 
They must serve without talking too 
much. They may give their counsel only 
when asked, and never obtrude it. They 
should 
praise 
the 
king 
on 
befitting 
occasions. All things, no matter how 
small, may be done only after informing 
the king, who is a veritable fire in human 
form. Do not go too near him, nor yet 
appear to avoid him. Even though a 
person may be trusted by the king and 
have 
great 
authority, 
still 
be 
should 
always 
behave 
as 
if 
he 
would 
be 
dismissed 
immediately, 
It 
would 
be 
foolishness to place too much confidence 
in a king. One may not sit in the 
conveyance, seat or chariot of the king, 
presuming on his affection. A servant of 
the king should ever be active and self-
restrained. He should not be excessively 
elated, nor unduly depressed, by being 
honored or dishonored by the king. He 
may not reveal the secrets confided to 
him, nor may he receive anything in the 
form of gift from the citizens. He should 
not be jealous of other servants.  The king 
may place fools in positions of authority, 
leaving aside the wise. Such waywardness 
should be ignored. One cannot be too 
careful with the ladies of the court. There 
should not be the faintest suggestion of 
indelicacy 
in 
one's 
conduct 
towards 
them."  
Dhaumya 
then 
blessed 
the 
Pandavas: 
"Live thus in patience for one year, 
serving the king Virata, and then, you will 
pass the rest of your days in happiness, 
regaining your lost throne." 
44. VIRTUE VINDICATED 
YUDHISHTHIRA put on the garb of a 
sanyasin. Arjuna transformed himself into 
a 
eunuch. 
Others 
also 
disguised 
themselves. But no disguise could take 
away their natural charm, grace and 
nobility of appearance. 
When they went to King Virata seeking 
service, they seemed to him born to 
command and rule rather than to serve. He 
hesitated, at first, to engage them in 
service 
but 
yielding 
to 
their 
urgent 
solicitations, he finally appointed them to 
the places they sought of him. 
Yudhishthira 
became 
the 
king's 
companion and spent his days in playing 
dice with him. Bhima worked as the chief 
of the cooks. He also entertained the king 
by wrestling with the reputed men of 
might whom came to the court, and by 
controlling wild animals. 
Arjuna assumed the name of Brihannala 
and 
taught 
dancing, 
singing 
and 
instrumental music to Princess Uttara, the 
daughter of Virata, and the ladies. Nakula 
looked after the horses and Sahadeva 
looked after the cows and the bulls.  
The princess Draupadi who, if fate had 
been less cruel, should herself have been 
served by many maids, had now to pass 
her days in serving Sudeshna, Virata's 
queen. She lived in the inner apartments 
of the palace as maid and companion, 
engaging herself in uncongenial tasks.  
Kichaka, the brother of Sudeshna, was the 
commander-in-chief of Virata's army and 
it was to him that the old king Virata 
owed his power and prestige. Kichaka 
wielded such vast influence that people 
used to say that Kichaka was the real king 
of the Matsya country and old Virata king 
only in name. 
Kichaka was inordinately vain of his 
strength and his influence over the king. 
He was so smitten with Draupadi's beauty 
that 
he 
conceived 
an 
uncontrollable 
passion for her. And he was so sure of his 
own attractions and power that it never 
occurred to him that she, though a mere 
maidservant could resist his will. He made 
amorous overtures to her, which greatly 
vexed her.  
Draupadi was too shy to speak of this to 
Sudeshna or to others. She gave out that 
her 
husbands 
were 
Gandharvas 
who 
would mysteriously kill those who tried to 
dishonor her.  
Her good conduct and lustre made every 
one believe in her story about the 
Gandharvas. But Kichaka was not to be 
frightened 
so 
easily 
and 
he 
sought 
persistently to seduce Draupadi.  
His persecution became so intolerable that 
at last she complained of it to Queen 
Sudeshna, and implored her protection. 
Kichaka, of course, had greater influence 
over 
his 
sister, 
and 
he 
shamelessly 
confided to her his unlawful passion for 
her maid and sought her aid to compass 
his wish. 
He represented himself as dying of desire. 
"I am so full of torment," he said, "that 
from the time I met your maid, I do not 
get any sleep or rest. You must save my 
life by managing somehow to make her 
receive 
my 
advances 
favorably." 
The 
queen tried to dissuade him but Kichaka 
would not listen. And finally Sudeshna 
yielded. Both of them decided upon a plan 
to entrap Draupadi.  
One 
night, 
many 
sweetmeats 
and 
intoxicating drinks were prepared in the 
house of Kichaka and a great feast was 
arranged. Sudeshna called Sairandhri to 
her side and handing her a beautiful 
golden jug bade her go and bring her a jug 
of wine from Kichaka's house. 
Draupadi hesitated to go to the house of 
the infatuated Kichaka at that hour and 
begged hard that someone else of her 
many 
attendants 
might 
be 
sent, 
but 
Sudeshna did not listen. She pretended to 
be angry and said sharply: "Go, you must. 
I can not send anyone else," and poor 
Draupadi had to obey. 
Draupadi's fears were justified. When she 
reached Kichaka's house, that wretch, 
maddened with lust and wine, began to 
pester her with urgent entreaties and 
solicitations.  
She rejected his prayers and said: "Why 
do you, who belong to a noble royal 
family, seek me, born of a low caste? 
Why do you take to the wrong path? Why 
do you approach me, a married lady? You 
will 
perish. 
My 
protectors, 
the 
Gandharvas, will kill you in their anger." 
When Draupadi would not yield to his 
entreaties, Kichaka seized her by the arm 
and pulled her about. But putting down 
the vessel she carried, she wrenched 
herself free and fled, hotly pursued by the 
maddened Kichaka.  
She fled to the court wailing loudly. But 
even there, intoxicated not only with 
wine, but even more by his power and 
influence, 
Kichaka 
followed 
her 
and 
kicked her in the presence of all with 
abusive words.  
Everyone was afraid of the all-powerful 
commander-in-chief and no one was bold 
enough to oppose him.  
Draupadi could not bear the sorrow and 
anger she felt at the thought of her 
helplessness under the intolerable insult 
offered to her.  
Her deep distress made her forget the 
danger that would befall the Pandavas if 
they were discovered prematurely. She 
went that night to Bhima and waking him 
up, gave vent to her agonized sense of 
wrong. 
After telling him how brutally Kichaka 
had 
pursued 
and 
insulted 
her, 
she 
appealed 
piteously 
to 
Bhima 
for 
protection and revenge. She said in a 
voice choked with sobs: 
"I cannot bear this any longer. You must 
kill this wretch at once. For your sake, to 
help you keep your promise, I serve in a 
menial office and even prepare sandal 
paste for Virata. I have not minded it, I, 
who have till now served only you or 
Mother Kunti, whom I love and honor. 
But now, I have to serve these wretches, 
fearful every moment of some disgraceful 
outrage. Not that I mind hard work, see 
my hands." And she showed her hands, 
which were cracked and stained with 
menial tasks. 
Bhima respectfully carried her hands to 
his face and eyes, and speechless with 
sorrow and pity and love, he dried her 
tears. Finally he found his voice, and said 
thickly:  
"I care not for the promise of Yudhishthira 
or the advice of Arjuna. I care not what 
may happen but I will do as you say. I will 
kill Kichaka and his gang here and now!" 
and he rose. 
But Draupadi warned Bhima not to be 
hasty. They talked it over and finally 
decided that Kichaka should be beguiled 
to come alone at night to a retired spot in 
the dancing hall where he should find 
waiting for him Bhima disguised as a 
woman, instead of Draupadi.  
Next 
morning, 
Kichaka 
renewed 
his 
hateful attentions and vaingloriously said 
to Draupadi: "O Sairandhri, I threw you 
down and kicked you in the presence of 
the king. Did any one there come forward 
to help you? Virata is only king in name 
of this Matsya country. But I, the 
commander-in-chief, 
am 
the 
real 
sovereign. Now, do not be a fool, but 
come and enjoy life with me, with all 
royal honors. I shall be your devoted 
servant." And he begged and bullied and 
cringed, devouring her the while with lust-
reddened eyes.  
Draupadi pretended to yield and said: 
"Kichaka, believe me, I can no longer 
resist your solicitations. But none of your 
companions or brothers should know of 
our relations. If you swear that you will 
faithfully keep the secret from others, I 
shall yield to your wish." 
Kichaka 
delightedly 
agreed 
to 
the 
condition and he promised to go alone to a 
place of assignation that very night. 
She said: "The women have their dancing 
lessons during daytime in the dancing hall 
and return to their own quarters at 
nightfall. None will be in the dancing hall 
at night. Come there tonight. I shall be 
waiting for you there. You can have your 
will of me." 
Kichaka reveled in happiness. That night, 
Kichaka took his bath, perfumed and 
decked himself, went to the dancing hall 
and finding with joy that the doors were 
open, gently entered the place.  
In the very dim light, he saw someone 
lying 
there 
on 
a 
couch, 
no 
doubt 
Sairandhri. He groped his way in the dark, 
and gently laid his hands on the person of 
the sleeper.  
Alas! It was not the soft form of 
Sairandhri that he touched but the iron 
frame of Bhima who lept forth on him like 
a lion on its prey and hurled him to the 
ground. But surprised as he was, Kichaka 
was no coward, and he was now fighting 
for dear life.  
Grimly they wrestled, Kichaka no doubt 
thinking he had to do with one of the 
Gandharva husbands. They were not ill 
matched, for at that time Bhima, Balarama 
and Kichaka were reputed to be in the 
same class in strength and wrestling skill.  
The struggle between Bhima and Kichaka 
was like that between Vali and Sugriva. In 
the end Bhima killed Kichaka, pounding 
and kneading his body into a shapeless 
lump of flesh. 
Then he gave the glad news of Kichaka's 
punishment to Draupadi and went in haste 
to his kitchen, bathed, rubbed sandal paste 
over his body and slept with satisfaction. 
Draupadi awoke the guards of the court 
and said to them: "Kichaka came to 
molest me, but as I had warned him, the 
Gandharvas, my husbands, made short 
work of him. Your commander-in-chief, 
who fell a prey to lust, has been killed. 
Look at him." And she showed them the 
corpse of Kichaka, which had been 
reduced to such a shapeless mass that it 
had no human semblance. 
45. MATSYA DEFENDED 
THE fate of Kichaka made Draupadi an 
object of fear to the people of Virata. 
"This 
woman, 
so 
beautiful 
that 
she 
captures all hearts, is as dangerous as she 
is lovely, for the Gandharvas guard her. 
She is a great danger to the people of the 
city and the members of the royal 
household, for the Gandharvas may stop 
at nothing in their jealous anger. It would 
be best to send her out of the city." 
Reflecting 
thus, 
the 
citizens 
went 
to 
Sudeshna and prayed to her to expel 
Draupadi.  
Sudeshna told Draupadi: "You are, no 
doubt, a very virtuous lady, but kindly 
leave our city. I have had enough of you." 
There was only one month more to 
complete the stipulated period of living 
incognito and Draupadi begged earnestly 
to be permitted to stay just another month 
by 
when, 
she 
said, 
her 
Gandharva 
husbands 
would 
have 
realised 
their 
objects and would be ready to take her 
away with them.  
The Gandharvas would be very grateful to 
King Virata and his kingdom. Whether 
grateful or not, the Gandharvas could be 
deadly if irritated and Sudeshna was too 
afraid of Draupadi to refuse her request.  
From the beginning of the thirteenth year, 
the 
spies 
of 
Duryodhana, 
under 
his 
express orders, had searched for the 
Pandavas in all possible places of hiding.  
After several months of futile search, they 
reported their failure to Duryodhana and 
added that probably the Pandavas had 
perished of privations.  
Then came the news that the powerful 
Kichaka had been killed in single combat 
by some Gandharva on account of a 
woman.  
There were only two persons who could 
kill Kichaka, and Bhima was one of them. 
And so they suspected that Bhima might 
have been the vengeful Gandharva who 
had killed Kichaka. Duryodhana also felt 
that the lady who was the cause of the 
killing might be Draupadi. He expressed 
his doubts in the open assembly. 
He said: "I suspect that the Pandavas are 
in Virata's city. Now, he is one of the 
kings who are too stiff-necked to court our 
friendship. It would be a good thing to 
invade his country and carry away his 
cows. If the Pandavas are hiding there, 
they will certainly come out to fight with 
us to repay Virata's hospitality and we can 
easily spot them. If we discover them 
there and we can sure before the stipulated 
time, they will have to go to the forest 
again for another twelve, years. If, on the 
other hand, the Pandavas are not there, 
there is nothing lost."  
King 
Susarma, 
the 
ruler 
of 
Trigarta 
heartily supported him. "The king of 
Matsya is my enemy." he said, "and 
Kichaka has given me a lot of trouble. 
Kichaka's death must have weakened 
Virata considerably. Give me leave to 
attack Virata now." 
Karna seconded this proposition. They 
unanimously came to the decision that 
Susarma should attack Matsya from the 
south and draw off the army of Virata to 
the south for defence. Duryodhana, with 
the Kaurava army, would then launch a 
surprise 
attack 
on 
Virata 
from 
the 
northern side, which would be relatively 
undefended.  
Susarma invaded Matsya from the south 
seized the cattle and laid waste the 
gardens and fields on the way. The 
cowherds ran in great distress to Virata, 
who now very much wished that Kichaka 
were alive, for he surely would have made 
short work of the raiders. When he said so 
to Kanka (the assumed name by which 
Yudhishthira was known in Virata's court) 
the latter said: "O king, be not worried. 
Even though I am a hermit, I am an expert 
in warfare. I shall put on armor and go in 
a chariot and drive away your enemies. 
Please instruct that your horse keeper 
Dharmagranthi, your chief cook Valala, 
and your stable herd Tantripala may also 
get into chariots and help us. I have heard 
that they are great fighters. Kindly give 
orders that the necessary chariots and the 
weapons may be given to us." 
Delighted, Virata was only too willing to 
accept the offer. The chariots were ready. 
All the Pandavas excepting Arjuna went 
out with the army of Virata to oppose 
Susarma and his men.  
A fierce fight ensued between the armies 
of Virata and Susarma, with much loss of 
life on both sides. Susarma attacked 
Virata 
and 
surrounded 
his 
chariot, 
compelling him to get down and fight on 
foot.  
Susarma captured Virata and held him 
captive in his chariot. With the capture of 
Virata, the army of Matsya lost heart and 
began to scatter in all directions, when 
Yudhishthira commanded Bhima to attack 
Susarma and release Virata and rally the 
scattered Matsya forces.  
At these words of Yudhishthira, Bhima 
was 
about 
to 
uproot 
a 
tree, 
but 
Yudhishthira stopped him and said: "No 
such tricks, please, and no battle cry or 
your identity will be revealed. Fight like 
anybody else from the chariot with your 
bows and arrows." 
Bhima accordingly got into the chariot 
attacked the enemy, set Virata free and 
captured Susarma. The dispersed forces of 
Matsya 
rallied 
into 
new 
formations 
charged 
and 
defeated 
the 
army 
of 
Susarma. 
As soon as the news of Susarma's defeat 
reached 
the 
city, 
the 
people 
were 
extremely jubilant. They decorated the 
city and went forth to welcome their 
victorious king back home.  
When they were thus making preparations 
to receive king Virata, the big army of 
Duryodhana came down on them from the 
north, and began despoiling the cattle 
ranches on the outskirts of the city.  
The Kaurava army marched in force and 
rounded up the countless cows that were 
there. The leader of the cowherds ran to 
the city and said to the prince Uttara: "O 
prince, the Kauravas are marching on, 
robbing us of our cows. King Virata has 
gone south to fight against the Trigarta. 
We are in consternation as there is no one 
to protect us. You are the king's son and 
we look to you for protection. Pray, come 
and recover the cows for the honor of 
your family."  
When the leader of the cowherds made 
this complaint to Uttara in the presence of 
the people and especially of the women of 
the palace, the prince felt flushed with 
valor and proudly said:  
"If only I can get someone to be my 
charioteer I will recover the cows single-
handed. Well, my feats of arms will be 
worth seeing and people will know there 
is little to choose between Arjuna and 
myself." 
When Uttara said these words Draupadi 
was in the inner apartments and must have 
laughed within herself.  
She ran to princess Uttara and said: "O 
princess, great danger has be fallen the 
country. The cowherds have complained 
to the young that the Kaurava army is 
advancing on our city from the north and 
has captured cattle ranches and cows on 
the outskirts. The prince is eager to fight 
them and is in need of a charioteer. 
Should such a small thing as that stand in 
the way of victory and glory? I tell you 
that 
Brihannala 
has 
been 
Arjuna's 
charioteer. When I was in the service of 
the queen of the Pandavas, I heard of this 
fact and I also know that Brihannala learnt 
archery from Arjuna. Order Brihannala 
immediately to go and drive the prince's 
chariot." 
Arjuna as Brihannala pretended to be 
unfamiliar with armor and raised a laugh 
at his awkwardness in wearing it.  
The women of the palace laughed at his 
fears and told him again not to be afraid 
for Uttara would look after him.  
Arjuna spent some time in such fun but, 
when he harnessed the horses, it could be 
seen that, at least, he was an expert 
charioteer. And when he held the reins, 
the horses seemed to love and obey him. 
"The prince will be victorious. We shall 
despoil the enemy of their embroidered 
robes and distribute them to you as the 
prize of victory" were the last words of 
Brihannala to the women of the palace, as 
the 
chariot 
rapidly 
bore 
the 
prince 
outwards to battle.  
46. PRINCE UTTARA 
UTTARA, the son of Virata, set off with 
enthusiasm from the city in his chariot 
with Brihannala as his charioteer and 
commanded the latter to drive quickly to 
the place where the Kauravas had rounded 
up the cows. 
Willingly, the horses were put to their best 
speed. And presently the Kaurava army 
was sighted, at first a gleaming, line, 
enveloped in a cloud of dust that seemed 
to go up to the skies.  
Going nearer, Uttara saw the great army 
drew in battle by Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, 
Duryodhana and Karna. At that sight, his 
courage, which had been gradually drying 
up during the rapid rush to the field, was 
quite gone. His mouth went dry and his 
hair stood on end. 
His limbs were all in a tremble. He shut 
his eyes with both his hands to keep out 
the fearsome sight. He said:"How can I, 
single-handed, attack an army? I have no 
troops, since the king, my father, has 
taken all available forces, leaving the city 
unprotected. It is absurd to think that one 
man can alone fight a well-equipped 
army, led by world-renowned warrior! Oh 
Brihannala, turn back the chariot." 
Brihannala laughed and said: "O prince, 
you started from the city, full of fierce 
determination and the ladies expect great 
things of you. The citizens also have put 
their trust in you. Sairandhri praised me 
and I have come at your request. If we 
return without recovering the cows, we 
shall become the laughing-stock of all. I 
will not turn back the chariot. Let us stand 
firm and fight. Have no fear." With these 
words Brihannala began to drive the 
chariot towards the enemy and they 
approached quite close to them.  
Uttara's distress was pitiable. He said in a 
quaking voice: "I cannot do it, I simply 
cannot. Let the Kauravas march off with 
the cows and if the women laugh, let 
them. I do not care. What sense is there in 
fighting people who are immeasurably 
stronger than we fight? Do not be a fool! 
Turn back the chariot. Otherwise, I shall 
jump out and walk back." With these 
words Uttara cast off his bows and 
arrows, got down from the chariot and 
began to fly towards the city, mad with 
panic.  
This should not be taken as something that 
has never happened in life. Nor is Uttara's 
panic during his first battle, by any means, 
singular.  
Fear is a strong instinctive feeling, though 
it can be overcome by will-power or 
strong motives like love, shame or hate, or 
more usually, by discipline. 
Even 
men 
who 
have 
afterwards 
distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
have confessed to having felt something 
like panic fear, the first time they came 
under fire. Uttara was by no means an 
exceptional coward, for he fought and fell 
gauntly at Kurukshetra. 
Arjuna 
pursued 
the 
running 
prince, 
shouting to him to stop and behave like a 
Kshatriya. 
The 
braided 
hair 
of 
the 
charioteer began to dance and his clothes 
began to wave as he ran in pursuit of 
Uttara. The prince fled hither and thither, 
trying to dodge the hands that would stop 
him.  
Those of the Kaurava army, who could 
see this spectacle, found it amusing. 
Drona was puzzled at the sight of 
Brihannala 
who, 
albeit 
dressed 
fantastically, seemed a man rigged out as 
a woman and to remind him curiously of 
Arjuna. 
When he remarked about this, Karna said: 
"How can this be Arjuna? What does it 
matter even if he is? What can Arjuna 
alone do against us in the absence of the 
other Pandavas? The king has left his son 
alone in the city and gone with his whole 
army to fight against Susarma. The young 
prince has brought the attendant of the 
ladies of the palace as his charioteer. That 
is all." 
Poor Uttara was imploring Brihannala to 
let him go, promising untold wealth if he 
did so. He appealed to his pity: "I am the 
only son of my mother. I am a child 
grown up on my mother's lap. I am full of 
fear."  
But, Brihannala wanted to save him from 
himself, and would not let him go. He 
pursued him, seized him and dragged him 
to the chariot by force.  
Uttara began to sob and said: "What a fool 
I was to brag! Alas! What will happen to 
me?"  
Arjuna said kindly, soothing the prince's 
fears: "Be not afraid. I shall fight with the 
Kauravas. Help me by looking after the 
horses and driving the chariot, and I shall 
do the rest. Believe me, no good ever 
came of flight. We will rout the enemy 
and recover your cows. You will have all 
the glory." With these words Arjuna lifted 
the prince on to the chariot and, putting 
the reins in his hands, asked him to drive 
towards a tree near the burial ground. 
Drona, who was watching all this intently, 
knew 
that 
the 
fantastically 
dressed 
charioteer was Arjuna and shared his 
knowledge with Bhishma.  
Duryodhana turned to Karna and said: 
"Why should we worry who he is? Even if 
he is Arjuna, he will be only playing into 
our hands, for his being discovered will 
send the Pandavas to the forest for another 
twelve years." 
As soon as they came near the tree 
Brihannala bade the prince get down, 
climb the tree and take down the arms 
hidden there. The prince said in alarm and 
grief: "People say that what hangs on this 
tree is the corpse of an old huntress. How 
can I touch a dead body? How can you 
ask me to do such a thing?" 
Arjuna said: "It is not a corpse, prince. I 
know that it contains the weapons of the 
Pandavas. Climb up the tree bravely and 
bring them down. Do not delay." 
Seeing that resistance was of no avail 
Uttara climbed up the tree as Brihannala 
had asked him to and took, in great 
disgust, the bag tied up there and came 
down.  
When the leather bag was opened, he saw 
weapons as bright as the sun. Uttara stood 
amazed at the sight of the gleaming 
weapons and covered his eyes.  
He mustered courage and touched them. 
The touch seemed to send a stream of 
hope and high courage into him. He asked 
with ardor: "O charioteer, what a wonder! 
You say that these bows, arrows and 
swords belong to the Pandavas. They have 
been deprived of their kingdom and they 
have retired to the forest. Do you know 
them? Where are they?"  
Then Arjuna told him briefly how they 
were all in Virata's court. He said: 
"Kanka, 
who 
serves 
the 
king, 
is 
Yudhishthira. 
Valala, 
the 
cook 
who 
prepares such nice dishes for your father, 
is none other than Bhima. Sairandhri, for 
insulting whom Kichaka was killed, is 
Draupadi. Dharmagranthi, who looks after 
the horses and Tantripala, the keeper of 
the cows, are Nakula and Sahadeva 
respectively. I am Arjuna. Be not afraid. 
O prince, you will soon see me defeat the 
Kauravas even in the sight of Bhishma, 
Drona and Aswatthama and recover the 
cows. You will also gain renown and it 
will be a lesson to you." 
Then Uttara folded his hands and said: "O 
Arjuna, how fortunate I am to see you 
with my own eyes! So, Arjuna is the 
victorious hero whose very contact has 
put heart and courage into me. Forgive the 
wrongs I have done through ignorance." 
As they approached the Kaurava host, 
Arjuna recounted some of his heroic 
deeds, so that Uttara might not lose grip of 
his newly awakened courage. Arriving in 
front of the Kauravas, he got down, 
prayed to God, removed the conch-
bangles from his hands and put on leather 
gauntlets. 
He then tied a cloth on his flowing hair, 
stood facing the east, meditated on his 
armor, got into the chariot and gloried in 
the familiar feel of his famous Gandiva 
bow. He stringed it and thrice twanged the 
string whose shrill note raised an echo 
from all sides.  
Hearing the sound, the heroes of the 
Kaurava army said to one another: "This 
surely is Gandiva's voice." When Arjuna 
stood on the chariot in all his godlike 
stature and blew his conch Devadatta, the 
Kaurava army was alarmed and a frenzied 
shout arose that the Pandavas had come.  
The story of Uttara, who spoke boastfully 
in the ladies' boudoirs and fled in panic at 
the sight of the hostile array, his not been 
introduced in the Mahabharata, merely as 
a comic interlude. 
It is in ordinary human nature to look with 
contempt on lower levels of conduct in 
ability. The rich scorn the poor, the 
beautiful scorn the plain, and the strong 
scorn the weak. Brave men despise 
cowards. But Arjuna was no ordinary 
man. He was a great soul and a true hero 
who felt that his duty as a strong, brave 
man was to help others to rise above their 
weakness. 
Knowing that nature had endowed him 
with courage and bravery at birth, and that 
he owed them to no special exertions on 
his part, he had the true humility of the 
really great. And he did what he could to 
put courage into Uttara and make him 
worthy of his lineage. This was Arjuna's 
characteristic nobility. He never abused 
his strength and power. One of his many 
names is Bibhatsu, which means one who 
shrank from doing an unworthy act, and 
he lived up to it. 
47. PROMISE FULFILLED 
THE chariot of Arjuna thundered on its 
way, seeming to shake the earth. The 
hearts of the Kauravas quaked when they 
heard the twang of the Gandiva bow. 
"Our army must be arrayed well and with 
care. Arjuna, has come," said Drona 
anxiously. Duryodhana did not at all like 
the honor Drona did Arjuna by this 
anxiety.  
He said to Karna: "The Pandavas' pledge 
was that they would spend twelve years in 
the 
forest 
and 
the 
following 
year 
undiscovered. The thirteenth year has not 
ended yet. Arjuna has revealed himself 
before the time. Why then should we give 
way to fear? The Pandavas will have to go 
again to the forest for another twelve 
years. Drona is suffering from the cold 
feet of the too learned. Let us leave him in 
the rear and advance to the battle." 
Karna assented and said: "Our soldiers' 
heart is not in the fight and they are 
trembling with fear. They say that the 
man, who stands so proudly, bow in hand, 
on the chariot, speeding towards us, is 
Arjuna. But why need we fear even if it 
were Parasurama? I will myself stop the 
advancing warrior and redeem my word to 
you, and fight him, aye, even if all the 
others stand back. They may drive away 
the cows of the Matsya king while, single 
handed, I shall give them cover, engaging 
Arjuna in battle," and Karna, as usual, 
began to blow his own trumpet. 
When Kripa heard these words of Karna, 
he said: "This is pure tomfoolery. We 
must all make a combined attack on 
Arjuna. That would be our one chance of 
success. Do not therefore, brag about your 
opposing him alone and unaided."  
Karna grew angry. He said: "The acharya 
ever delights in singing Arjuna's praises 
and in magnifying his prowess. Whether 
he does so from fear or excessive 
fondness for the Pandavas, I do not know. 
Those, who are afraid, need not fight, but 
may simply look on, while others, who are 
true to the salt they have eaten, engage in 
battle. I, for one, a mere soldier who loves 
my friends and hates my enemies, will 
stand here and fight. What business have 
men learned in the Vedas, who love and 
praise their enemies, got here?" said he 
sneeringly.  
Aswatthama, Drona's son and Kripa's 
nephew, could not hear unmoved this 
sneer at the venerable teachers. He said 
sternly to Karna: "We have not yet taken 
the king back to Hastinapura, and the 
battle is yet to be won. Your brag is idle 
vainglory. It may be that we are not 
kshatriyas and that we belong to the class 
that recites the Vedas and the sastras. But 
I have not been able to find in any sastra 
that it is honor able for kings to seize 
kingdoms by cheating at dice. Even those, 
who fight and conquer kingdoms, do not 
crow too loudly about it. And I cannot see 
what you have done to be proud of. The 
fire is silent and yet cooks the food. The 
sun shines but not on him. Likewise, 
Mother earth sustains all things, movable 
and immovable, and supports her burden 
without so much as a whisper. What claim 
to praise has a kshatriya who has 
unlawfully seized another's kingdom at a 
game of dice? To have cheated the 
Pandavas of their kingdom is no more a 
matter of glory than to have spread traps 
for unsuspecting birds. O Duryodhana, O 
Karna, in what battle did your heroes 
defeat 
the 
Pandavas? 
You 
dragged 
Draupadi to the assembly. Are you proud 
of it? You have destroyed the Kaurava 
race like an empty-headed clod that fells a 
big sandal tree for love of its fragrance. A 
fight with Arjuna, you will find, is a very 
different thing from a throw of the dice. 
The Gandiva will send forth sharp arrows 
and not fours and twos as in the game of 
dice. Vain fools, do you think that Sakuni 
can, by mere cheating, sneak a victory in 
battle for you?" 
The leaders of the Kaurava army lost their 
patience and began a loud wordy warfare. 
Seeing this, the grandsire was filled with 
sorrow and said: 
"The wise man does not insult his 
teachers. One should engage in battle only 
after a careful calculation of time, place 
and circumstance. Even wise people often 
lose their balance and good sense over 
their own affairs. Ruffled by anger, even 
the usually so sensible Duryodhana fails 
to recognise that the warrior who stands 
braving our army is Arjuna. His intellect 
has 
been 
clouded 
by 
anger. 
O 
Aswatthama, pray do not mind Karna's 
offensive remarks. You must take them as 
intended merely to put the preceptors on 
their best spirit and sting them into action. 
This is not the time to nurse enmity or 
sow 
dissension. 
Drona, 
Kripa 
and 
Aswatthama should forget and forgive. 
Where can the Kauravas find in the whole 
world, heroes superior to Drona, the 
preceptor, and his son Aswatthama, who 
combine in themselves Vedic scholarship 
and kshatriya heroism? We know of none 
other than Parasurama who can equal 
Drona. We can conquer Arjuna only if we 
all join together and fight him. Let us 
address ourselves to the task before us. If 
we quarrel amongst ourselves we cannot 
fight Arjuna." 
Thus spoke the grandsire. Soothed by his 
noble words, angry feelings subsided. 
Bhishma 
turned 
to 
Duryodhana 
and 
continued: 
"Best of kings, Arjuna has come. The 
stipulated 
period 
of 
thirteen 
years 
terminated yesterday. Your calculation is 
wrong, as men learned in the science of 
planetary movements will tell you. I knew 
that the period had ended when Arjuna 
blew his conch. Reflect a little before 
deciding on war. If you wish to make 
peace with the Pandavas, now is the time 
for it. What do you seek, a just and 
honorable peace or a mutually destructive 
war? Ponder well and make your choice." 
Duryodhana replied: "Revered sire, I have 
no wish for peace. I shall not give even a 
village to the Pandavas. Let us get ready 
for war." 
Then Drona said: "Let prince Duryodhana 
take away a fourth of the army to guard 
him and return to Hastinapura. Let another 
surround the cows and seize them. If we 
return without seizing the cows it would 
amount to an acknowledgment of defeat. 
With the rest of the army, the five of us 
will give battle to Arjuna."  
The Kaurava forces ranged themselves 
accordingly in battle array. Arjuna said: 
"O Uttara, I do not see Duryodhana's 
chariot or Duryodhana. I see Bhishma 
standing, 
clad 
in 
armor. 
I 
think 
Duryodhana is driving away the cows to 
Hastinapura. Let us pursue him and 
recover the cows." With these words 
Arjuna moved away from the Kaurava 
army and went after Duryodhana and the 
cows.  
And as he was going, he respect fully 
greeted his teachers and the old grandsire, 
by drawing his Gandiva bow and sending 
arrows so as to fall near their feet.  
Reverently saluting them in this heroic 
fashion, 
he 
left 
them 
and 
pursued 
Duryodhana. Arjuna reached the place 
where the cows were gathered and put to 
rout the marauding forces.  
He then turned to the cowherds and asked 
them to take the cows to the barns, which 
they did with great rejoicing. Arjuna then 
pursued 
Duryodhana. 
Seeing 
this, 
Bhishma and the other Kaurava warriors 
rushed to the rescue and, surrounding 
Arjuna, sent forth arrows against him. 
Arjuna carried on a wonderful fight. First, 
he made at Karna and drove him from the 
battlefield. After that, he attacked and 
defeated Drona. Seeing Drona standing 
spent with fatigue, Aswatthama joined in 
the fight and attacked Arjuna, which gave 
Arjuna an opportunity of letting Drona 
withdraw from the field.  
Then, 
there 
ensued 
a 
bitter 
struggle 
between Aswatthama and Arjuna. When 
Aswatthama grew weary, Kripa relieved 
him and maintained the attack against 
Arjuna.  
But Kripa also sustained defeat and the 
whole army was routed and fled in fear. 
Though rallied and brought back to the 
attack by Bhishma, Drona and others, 
there was no fight left in them. Finally, 
they left the field, after a glorious fight 
between Bhishma and Arjuna, which, it is 
said, the gods themselves came to see. 
The attempt to head off Arjuna’s pursuit 
of Duryodhana thus failed and soon 
Arjuna came up with Duryodhana and 
strongly attacked him. Duryodhana was 
defeated and fled from the battlefield, but 
not far, because, when Arjuna taunted him 
with cowardice, he turned round like a 
serpent and resumed the fight.  
Bhishma 
and 
others 
surrounded 
and 
protected him. Arjuna fought and finally, 
he employed a magic weapon that made 
them all fall down unconscious on the 
battlefield. 
While 
they 
were 
in 
that 
condition 
he 
snatched 
away 
their 
garments. The seizure of the clothes of the 
enemy was the sign of decisive victory in 
those days. 
When Duryodhana came, Bhishma sent 
him back to the city. The whole army 
returned 
to 
Hastinapura 
after 
this 
humiliating defeat.  
Arjuna said: "O Uttara, turn back the 
horses. Our cows have been regained. Our 
enemies have fled. O prince, return to 
your kingdom, adorning your person with 
sandal paste and decked with flowers."  
On the way back, Arjuna deposited the 
weapons as before on the tree and dressed 
himself once more as Brihannala. He sent 
messengers in advance to proclaim in the 
city that Uttara had won a glorious 
victory. 
48. VIRATA'S DELUSION 
AFTER 
defeating 
Susarma, 
king 
of 
Trigarta, Virata returned to his capital 
amidst the acclamations of the citizens. 
When he reached his palace, he saw that 
Uttara was not there and the womenfolk 
told him with much elation that Uttara had 
set out to conquer the Kauravas.  
They had not a doubt that their hand some 
prince could conquer the whole world. 
But the king's heart sank within him at the 
news, for he knew the impossible task 
which the delicately nurtured prince had 
taken on himself with no better following 
than a eunuch.  
"My dearly loved son must be dead by 
now," 
he 
cried, 
overwhelmed 
with 
anguish. 
He 
then 
bade 
his 
ministers 
collect and send as strong a force as could 
be got together for rescuing Uttara if he 
was still alive and bring him back. Scouts 
also were immediately despatched to find 
out Uttara's whereabouts and fate.  
Dharmaputra, 
now 
disguised 
as 
the 
sanyasin Kanka, tried to comfort Virata by 
assuring him that the prince could come to 
no harm, since Brihannala had gone as his 
charioteer. "You do not know about her," 
said he. "I do. Whosoever fights from a 
chariot driven by her, can be sure of 
victory. Further, the news of Susarma's 
defeat must have reached there and the 
Kauravas must have retreated." 
Meanwhile courtiers arrived from the field 
of battle with the glad news that Uttara 
had defeated the Kaurava forces and 
recovered the kine.  
This seemed too good to be true, even to 
the 
fond 
father, 
but 
Yudhishthira 
smilingly reassured him. Said he: "Have 
no doubts, O king. What the messengers 
say must be true. When Brihannala went 
out as charioteer, success was certain. 
There is nothing extraordinary in your 
son's victory. I happen to know that even 
Indra's charioteer or Krishna's cannot 
equal Brihannala." 
This seemed absurd to Virata, but he was 
too happy to resent it. He made large gifts 
of precious stones and other wealth to the 
messengers who brought the good news 
and ordered public rejoicing. "My success 
over Susarma is nothing," he proclaimed. 
"The prince's is the real victory. Let 
special prayers of thanksgiving be offered 
at all places of worship. Let all the 
principal streets are decorated with flags 
and the citizen’s go in procession to 
strains of triumphal music. Make all 
arrangements to receive, in a befitting 
manner, my lion-hearted boy." 
Virata sent out ministers, soldiers, and 
maidens to welcome his son, returning in 
triumph. When the king retired to his 
private apartments, he asked Sairandhri to 
bring the dice. He said to Kanka: "I cannot 
contain my joy. Come, let us play," and 
sat down to a game with Yudhishthira. 
They 
talked 
while 
they 
played 
and 
naturally, the king was full of his son's 
greatness and prowess. "See the glory of 
my son, Bhuminjaya. He has put the 
famed Kaurava warriors to flight." 
"Yes," replied Yudhishthira with a smile. 
"Your son is indeed fortunate for, without 
the best of good fortune, how could he 
have secured Brihannala to drive his 
chariot?" 
Virata 
was 
angry 
at 
this 
persistent 
glorification of Brihannala at the expenses 
of Uttara. "Why do you, again and again 
babble about the eunuch?" he cried.  
"While I am talking about my son's 
victory, you expatiate on the charioteering 
skill of the eunuch, as if that were of any 
significance." 
The 
king's 
anger 
only 
increased when Kanka remonstrated: "I 
know what I am talking about. Brihannala 
is no ordinary person. The chariot she 
drives can never see defeat, and whoever 
is in it, is sure of success in any 
undertaking, no matter how difficult."  
Now, this perverse flouting could not be 
borne, and Virata in a passion flung the 
dice at Yudhishthira's face and followed 
this up with a blow on Yudhishthira's 
cheek. Yudhishthira was hurt and blood 
flowed down his face. 
Sairandhri who was nearby, wiped the 
blood with the edge of her garment and 
squeezed it into a golden cup. "Why all 
this fuss? What are you collecting the 
blood into a cup for?" demanded the angry 
king, who was still in a passion. 
"A Sanyasin's blood may not be split on 
the ground, O king," replied Sairandhri. 
"The rains will fail in your land for as 
many years as there are drops in the blood 
that is split on the earth. That was why I 
collected the blood in this cup. I fear you 
do not know Kanka's greatness." 
Meanwhile 
the 
gatekeeper 
announced: 
"Uttara and Brihannala have arrived. The 
prince is waiting for an audience with the 
king." Virata got up excitedly and said: 
"Ask 
him 
in, 
ask 
him 
in." 
And 
Yudhishthira whispered to the sentry: "Let 
Uttara come alone. Brihannala should stay 
behind." 
He did this to prevent a catastrophe, for he 
knew Arjuna would be unable to control 
his anger when he saw the injury on his 
brother's face. He could not bear to see 
Dharmaputra hurt by anyone except in fair 
battle.  
Uttara entered and paid due homage to his 
royal father. When he turned to do 
obeisance to Kanka be was horrified to 
see his bleeding face, for now he knew 
that Kanka was the great Yudhishthira. 
"O king," he cried, "who was it that 
caused hurt to this great one?" 
Virata looked at his son and said: "Why 
all this fuss about it? I struck him for 
untimely and envious belittling of you 
when I was in an ocean of delight at the 
news of your glorious victory. Each time I 
mentioned you, this unlucky brahmana 
extolled your charioteer, the eunuch, and 
gave the victory to him. It was too silly 
really, and I am sorry I struck him, but it 
is not worth talking about."  
Uttara was overwhelmed with fear. "Alas! 
You have done great wrong. Fall at his 
feet 
right 
now, 
father, 
and 
pray 
forforgiveness or we will be destroyed, 
root and branch." 
Virata, to whom all this was inexplicable, 
stood with a puzzled frown not knowing 
what to do. But Uttara was so anxious and 
importunate that he yielded and bowed to 
Yudhishthira asking for pardon. 
Thereafter, embracing his son and making 
him sit, Virata said: "My boy, you are 
truly a hero. I am in a fever of impatience 
to hear all about it. How did you defeat 
the Kaurava army? How did you recover 
the kine?"  
Uttara hung his head down. "I conquered 
no army," he said, "and rescued no cows. 
All that was the work of a god prince. He 
took up our cause, rescued me from 
destruction, put the Kaurava soldiers to 
flight and brought the herd back. I did 
nothing."  
The king could hardly believe his ears. 
"Where is that god prince?" he asked. "I 
must see and thank the hero who rescued 
my son and beat back my foes. I will give 
my daughter, Uttara, in marriage to him. 
Go and fetch him in." 
"He has disappeared for the time being," 
replied the prince, "but I think he will 
come again either today or tomorrow." 
Uttara spoke thus because Arjuna was 
indeed a prince of the gods and had also 
for 
the 
time 
being 
disappeared 
in 
Brihannala. 
In Virata's hall of assembly, all the 
leading citizens had gathered to celebrate 
the king's victory and the prince's. Kanka, 
Valala the cook, Brihannala, Tantripala 
and Dharmagranthi, who were responsible 
for the victories, arrived also and entering 
the hall, to the surprise of everyone, sat 
among the princes unbid.  
Some explained the conduct by saying 
that, after all, these humbler folk had 
rendered invaluable service at a critical 
time and really deserved recognition. 
Virata entered the court. On seeing Kanka 
sanyasin and the cook and the others 
seated in places reserved for princess and 
the nobility the king lost his temper and 
gave loud vent to his displeasure.  
When they felt they had enough fun, the 
Pandavas disclosed their identity to the 
amazement of all present. Virata was 
beside himself with joy to think that it was 
the Pandava princes and Panchali who had 
been ministering to him all these days in 
disguise. 
He 
embraced 
Kanka 
in 
exuberant gratitude and made a formal 
surrender of his kingdom and his all to 
him, 
of 
course 
immediately 
receiving 
them 
back 
with 
thanks. 
Virata 
also 
insisted that he should give his daughter in 
marriage to Arjuna. 
But Arjuna said: "No, that would not be 
proper, for the princess learnt dancing and 
music from me. I, as her teacher, am in 
the 
position 
of 
father 
to 
her." 
He, 
however, agreed to accept her for his son 
Abhimanyu. 
Meanwhile, 
envoys 
arrived 
from 
the 
wicked and treacherous Duryodhana with 
a message for Yudhishthira. "O son of 
Kunti," they said, "Duryodhana feels very 
sorry that owing to the hasty action of 
Dhananjaya, you have to go back to the 
woods again. He let himself be recognised 
before the end of the thirteenth year and 
so, in accordance with your undertaking, 
you have to dwell in the forest for another 
twelve years."  
Dharmaputra 
laughed 
and 
said: 
"Messengers, 
return 
quickly 
to 
Duryodhana and tell him to make further 
inquiry. 
The 
venerable 
Bhishma 
and 
others learned in the stars will no doubt 
tell him that full thirteen years had been 
completed before your forces heard again 
the twang of Dhananjaya's bow and fled in 
fear."  
49. TAKING COUNSEL 
THE thirteenth year during which the 
Pandavas had to remain undiscovered 
came to an end.  
No longer obliged to be in disguise, they 
left Virata's capital as Pandavas and 
settled openly in Upaplavya, another place 
in Matsya territory. From there, they sent 
emissaries to summon their friends and 
relatives.  
From 
Dwaraka 
came 
Balarama 
and 
Krishna with Arjuna’s wife Subhadra, and 
her son, Abhimanyu and accompanied by 
many Yadava warriors. Loud and long 
was the blare of trumpet-conchs as the 
Matsya prince and the Pandavas went 
forth to receive Janardana.  
Indrasena and many others like him, who 
had at the beginning of the preceding year 
left the Pandavas in the forest, rejoined 
them with their chariots at Upaplavya. 
The Kasi prince and Saibya ruler arrived 
with their forces.  
Drupada, the Panchala prince, was there 
too with three divisions, bringing with 
him Sikhandin and Draupadi's sons and 
her brother Dhrishtadyumna. There were 
many 
other 
princes 
gathered 
at 
Upaplavya, well attached to the Pandavas, 
Abhimanyu's marriage to princess Uttara 
was solemnized according to Vedic rites 
before that illustrious gathering of friendly 
heroes. The wedding celebrations over, 
they met in conclave in Virata's hall of 
assembly.  
Krishna sat next to Yudhishthira and 
Virata, while Balarama and Satyaki were 
seated beside Drupada. As the bustle died 
down, all eyes were turned on Krishna, 
who now rose to speak.  
"You all know," said Krishna to the 
hushed assembly, "the story of the great 
deceit how Yudhishthira was cheated at 
the game board and deprived of his 
kingdom and exiled with his brothers and 
Draupadi to the forest. For thirteen years, 
the sons of Pandu have patiently borne 
their 
trouble 
in 
redemption 
of 
their 
pledged word. Ponder well and counsel a 
course, which will be in consonance with 
dharma and contribute to the glory and 
welfare of both Pandavas and Kauravas. 
For, Dharmaputra desires nothing that he 
cannot justly claim. He wishes nothing but 
good even to the sons of Dhritarashtra 
who deceived him and did him grievous 
wrong. In giving your counsel, bear in 
mind the fraud and meanness of the 
Kauravas 
as 
well 
as 
the 
honorable 
magnanimity of the Pandavas. Devise a 
just and honorable settlement. We do not 
know what Duryodhana has in his mind. I 
feel we should send an able and upright 
emissary to him to persuade him to a 
peaceful settlement by the restoration of 
half the kingdom to Yudhishthira." 
Balarama 
then 
rose 
to 
address 
the 
gathering. "You have just heard Krishna," 
he said. "The solution he propounds is 
wise and just. I endorse it as good for both 
Duryodhana and Dharmaputra. If Kunti's 
sons can get back their kingdom by a 
peaceful 
settlement, 
nothing 
could 
be 
better for them, the Kauravas and for all 
concerned. 
Only 
then 
will 
there 
be 
happiness and peace in the land. Someone 
has to go to convey to Duryodhana 
Yudhishthira's 
wish 
for 
a 
peaceful 
settlement and bring an answer from him, 
a man who has the weight and the ability 
to 
bring 
about 
peace 
and 
good 
understanding. The envoy should get the 
cooperation 
of 
Bhishma, 
Dhritarashtra, 
Drona and Vidura, Kripa and Aswatthama 
and even of Karna and Sakuni if possible, 
and secure support for Kunti's sons. He 
should be one who, on no account, would 
give way to anger. Dharmaputra, with full 
knowledge of consequences, staked his 
kingdom 
and 
lost 
it, 
obstinately 
disregarding 
the 
reasoning 
of 
friends. 
Fully aware that he was no match for the 
adept Sakuni, he yet played against him. 
He cannot now complain but can only 
supplicate for his rights. A fit envoy 
would be one who is not a warmonger but 
is dead set, in spite of every difficulty, on 
achieving a peaceful settlement. Princes, I 
desire 
you 
to 
approach 
Duryodhana 
tactfully and make peace with him. Let us 
avoid an armed conflict by all the means 
in our power. Only that which accrues in 
peace is worth while. Out of war, nothing 
but wrong can issue." 
Balarama's position was that Yudhishthira 
knew what he was doing when he 
gambled away his kingdom and could not 
now claim it as of right.  
The fulfilment of the conditions of exile 
could 
only 
give 
the 
Pandavas 
their 
personal freedom and not their kingdom, 
that is to say, they need not serve another 
term of exile in the forest. But it gave 
them no right to the return of their 
kingdom.  
Dharmaputra could only supplicate for the 
return of what he had lost and not claim it 
as of right. Balarama did not relish an 
armed conflict among scions of the same 
family and rightly held that war would 
lead only to disaster. 
The 
poet 
puts 
an 
eternal 
truth 
in 
Balarama's mouth.  
Satyaki, the Yadava warrior, who heard 
Balarama speak thus, could not contain 
himself. He rose in anger and spoke 
indignantly: 
"Balarama's words do not strike me as in 
the least degree just. One can, if skilful 
enough, make out a plausible plea for any 
case, but not all the skill in the world can 
convert wrong into right or injustice into 
justice. I must protest against Balarama's 
stand, which fills me with disgust. Do we 
not see in one and the same tree, one 
branch bowed with fruit and another 
sticking out gaunt and useless? So, of 
these brothers, Krishna speaks words that 
breathe 
the 
spirit 
of 
dharma 
while 
Balarama's attitude is unworthy. And if 
you grant what cannot be doubted that the 
Kauravas cheated Yudhishthira of his 
share of the kingdom, why then, allowing 
them to keep it is as unjust as confirming 
a thief in the possession of his booty! 
Anyone, 
who 
finds 
fault 
with 
Dharmaputra, does so in cowardly fear of 
Duryodhana, not for any sound reason. O 
princes, forgive my harsh speech. Not of 
his own volition but because the Kauravas 
pressed and invited him to do so, did the 
novice and unwilling Dharmaputra play 
with a dishonest gambler that game so 
fraught with disaster. Why should he bow 
and supplicate before Duryodhana, now 
that 
he 
has 
fulfilled 
his 
pledges? 
Yudhishthira is not a mendicant and need 
not beg. He has kept his word and so have 
his brothers twelve years in exile in the 
forest and twelve months there after in 
disguise according to their pledge. And 
yet, Duryodhana and his associates, most 
shamelessly and dishonestly, question the 
performance. I shall defeat these impudent 
villains in battle and they shall either seek 
Yudhishthira's pardon or meet their doom. 
How can a righteous war be wrong in any 
case? There is no sin in slaying enemies 
who take up arms and fight. To supplicate 
before the enemy, is to incur disgrace. If 
Duryodhana desires war, he can have it 
and we shall be quite ready for it. Let 
there be no delay and let us get on with 
the preparations. Duryodhana is not going 
to part with territory without a war and it 
would be folly to waste time."  
Drupada's 
heart 
was 
gladdened 
by 
Satyaki's resolute words. He rose and said: 
"Satyaki is right and I support him. Soft 
words will not bring Duryodhana round to 
reason. Let us continue our preparations 
for war and let our friends be warned 
without loss of time to bring up their 
forces. Send word instantly to Salya, 
Dhrishtaketu, Jayatsena and Kekaya. We 
must, of course, send a suitable envoy to 
Dhritarashtra. The learned brahmana, who 
conducts the religious ceremonies in my 
court, can be sent to Hastinapura, with 
confidence. Instruct him well as to what 
he should say to Duryodhana and how he 
should convey the message to Bhishma, 
Dhritarashtra and Dronacharya." 
When 
Drupada 
concluded, 
Vasudeva 
(Krishna, the son of Vasudeva) rose and 
addressing Drupada, said: 
"What you suggest is practicable and also 
conforms to the kingly code. Baladeva 
and I are bound to the Kauravas and the 
Pandavas with equal ties of affection. We 
came here for princess Uttara's wedding 
and will return now to our city. Great are 
you among the princes of the land, alike in 
age and wisdom, and entitled to advise us 
all. 
Dhritarashtra 
too 
holds 
you, 
his 
boyhood friends, in high esteem like 
Drona and Kripa. It is therefore only right 
that you should instruct the brahmana 
envoy on his mission of peace. If he fails 
to persuade Duryodhana out of his error, 
prepare for the inevitable conflict, my 
friends, and send word to us."  
The conference ended and Krishna left for 
Dwaraka with his people. The Pandavas 
and 
their 
allies 
went 
on 
with 
their 
preparations. Messengers went forth to all 
the friendly princes who got busy and 
mobilised their respective armies. 
Meanwhile, Duryodhana and his brothers 
were not idle. They also began preparing 
for the coming conflict and sent word to 
their friends to get their contingents ready 
for war.  
News of these preparations on both sides 
soon spread through out the land. "The 
constant rapid journeying back and forth 
of princes caused a great stir everywhere. 
The earth shook beneath the heavy tramp 
of marching legions," says the poet. 
It would appear that even in olden days, 
military preparations were made in much 
the same way as in our times.  
Drupada called in his brahmana and said 
to him: "You know Duryodhana's bent of 
mind as well as the qualities of the 
Pandavas. Go to him as the emissary of 
the Pandavas. The Kauravas deceived the 
Pandavas with the connivance of their 
father Dhritarashtra who would not listen 
to the sage advice of Vidura. Show the 
old, weak king, who is misled by his son, 
the path of dharma and wisdom. You will 
find in Vidura a great ally in this task. 
Your mission may lead to differences of 
opinion among the elder statesmen such 
as Bhishma, Drona and Kripa as well as 
among the warlords. And, if this happens, 
it 
will 
be 
some 
time 
before 
those 
differences are smoothed out, which will 
be time gained for the completion of the 
Pandavas war preparations. As long as 
you are in Duryodhana's capital talking of 
peace, their preparations for war will 
receive a set-back which is all to the good 
from the Pandavas' standpoint. If, by a 
miracle, you are able to come back with 
good terms of peace, so much the better. I 
do not expect Duryodhana will agree to a 
peaceful settlement. Still, to send one on a 
peace mission will be advantageous to 
us."  
In December 1941, the Japanese were 
carrying 
on 
negotiations 
with 
the 
Americans 
and, 
immediately 
on 
the 
breakdown of those talks, took them 
unawares 
and 
attacked 
Pearl 
Harbor 
destroying their naval forces there.  
Drupada's instruction to the brahmana 
would show that this was no new 
technique. And that, even in the old days, 
the same method was followed of carrying 
on 
negotiations 
and 
even 
sincerely 
working for peace, but simultaneously 
preparing, 
with 
unremitting 
vigor, 
for 
outbreak of war and carrying on peace 
talks with the object of creating dissension 
in the enemy's ranks. There is nothing 
new under the sun! 
50. ARJUNA'S CHARIOTEER 
HAVING sent Drupada's brahmana to 
Hastinapura on the peace mission, the 
Pandavas sent word, at the same time, to 
the princes likely to favor their cause to 
collect their forces and hold themselves in 
readiness for war. To Dwaraka, Arjuna 
went himself. 
Having understood through his spies the 
turn events were taking, Duryodhana too 
did 
not 
remain 
idle. 
Learning 
that 
Vasudeva (Krishna) was back in his home 
city, he sped towards Dwaraka in his 
chariot, as fast as his swiftest horses could 
take him. The two of them, Arjuna and 
Duryodhana, thus reached Dwaraka on the 
same day.  
Krishna was fast asleep. Because they 
were his close relatives, Arjuna and 
Duryodhana could go into his bedroom. 
There they both waited for Krishna to 
wake up. Duryodhana, who went in first, 
seated himself on a decorated throne-chair 
at the head of the bed, while Arjuna kept 
standing at its foot with arms folded in 
respectful posture.  
When Mahadeva woke up, his eyes fell on 
Arjuna who stood in front of him and he 
gave him warm welcome. Turning then to 
Duryodhana, he welcomed him too and 
asked them what brought them both to 
Dwaraka. Duryodhana was the first to 
speak.  
"It looks," said he, "as though war would 
break out between us soon. If it does, you 
must support me. Arjuna and I are equally 
beloved of you. We both claim equally 
close relationship with you. You cannot 
say that either of us is nearer to you than 
the other. I came here before Arjuna. 
Tradition has it that he who came first 
should be shown preference. Janardana, 
you are the greatest among the great; so it 
is incumbent on you to set an example to 
others. Confirm with your conduct the 
traditional dharma and remember that it 
was I who came first." 
To 
which 
Purushottama 
(Krishna) 
answered: "Son of Dhritarashtra, it may be 
that you came here first, but it was Kunti's 
son that I saw immediately on waking up. 
If you were the first arrival, it was Arjuna 
who first caught my eye. So, even in this 
respect, your claims on me are equal and I 
am therefore bound to render assistance to 
both sides. In distributing favors, the 
traditional usage is to begin with the 
junior-most among the recipients. I would, 
therefore, offer the choice to Arjuna first. 
The Narayana, my tribesmen, are my 
equals in battle and constitute a host, large 
and almost invincible. In my distribution 
of assistance, they will be on one side, and 
I individually on the other. But I shall 
wield no weapon and take no part in 
actual fighting."  
Turning to Arjuna he said, "Partha, think 
it over well. Would you want me, alone 
and weaponless, or would you prefer the 
prowess of the Narayana? Exercise the 
right to the first choice which custom 
gives you as the younger man." 
Scarcely 
had 
Krishna 
finished 
when 
Arjuna said with reverence and without 
hesitation: "I would be content if you are 
with us, though you may wield no 
weapon."  
Duryodhana could hardly contain himself 
for joy at what he thought was Arjuna's 
imbecile choice. He gladly chose the help 
of Vasudevas army and his request was 
granted. Pleased with the acquisition of a 
mighty 
force, 
Duryodhana 
went 
to 
Baladeva and told him the story.  
As 
he 
finished speaking, the mighty 
Balarama said: "Duryodhana, they must 
have told you all I said at the time of the 
marriage of Virata's daughter. I pleaded 
your case and urged everything that could 
be said for you. Often have I told Krishna 
that we have equal ties with the Kauravas 
and the Pandavas. But my words failed to 
carry conviction to him. I am helpless. It 
is impossible for me to side with one 
whom Krishna opposes. I will not help 
Partha and I cannot support you against 
Krishna. Duryodhana, you come of an 
illustrious line, which is respected by all 
the princes of the land. Well, then, if it 
must be war, bear yourself in accordance 
with the Kshatriya code," said he. 
Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura in 
high spirits saying to himself: "Arjuna has 
made a fool of himself. The great army of 
Dwaraka will fight on my side and 
Balarama's good wishes too are with me. 
Vasudeva has been left without an army."  
"Dhananjaya, why did you choose thus 
unwisely, 
preferring 
me 
alone 
and 
unarmed to my fully equipped and heroic 
forces?" asked Krishna of Arjuna with a 
smile, when they were alone. Arjuna 
answered:  
"My ambition is to achieve glory even like 
yours. You have the power and prowess to 
face all the princes of the land and their 
hordes in battle single-handed. I too feel I 
can do it. So, I desire that I should win the 
battle 
with 
you 
driving 
my 
chariot 
unarmed. I have desired this for long and 
you have today fulfilled my wish."  
Vasudeva smiled again and pronounced 
this 
benediction: 
"Are 
you 
trying 
to 
compete with me? May you succeed," for 
he was pleased with Arjuna's decision. 
This is the sacred story of how Krishna 
became Partha's charioteer. 
51. SALYA AGAINST HIS NEPHEWS 
SALYA, the ruler of Madradesa, was the 
brother of Madri, the mother of Nakula 
and Sahadeva. He heard that the Pandavas 
were camping in the city of Upaplavya 
and making preparations for war.  
He collected a very big army and set off 
towards that city to join the Pandavas. 
Salya's army was so large that where it 
halted for rest, the encampment extended 
over a length of nearly fifteen miles.  
News of Salya and his marching forces 
reached Duryodhana. Deciding that Salya 
should somehow be persuaded to join his 
side, Duryodhana instructed his officers to 
provide him and his great army with all 
facilities and treat them to sumptuous 
hospitality.  
In 
accordance 
with 
Duryodhana's 
instruction, several beautifully decorated 
rest houses were erected at several places 
on the route, at which Salya and his men 
were treated to wondrous hospitality. 
Food and drink were lavishly provided.  
Salya was exceedingly pleased with the 
attentions paid to him but assumed that his 
nephew, Yudhishthira, had arranged all 
this. Salya's army marched on, the earth 
shaking beneath their heavy strides.  
Feeling very pleased with the hospitality, 
he called the waiting attendants one day 
and said to them: 
"I must reward you all who have treated 
me and my soldiers with so much love 
and attention. Please tell Kunti's son that 
he should let me do this, and bring me his 
consent." 
The servants went and told their master, 
Duryodhana, this. Duryodhana, who was 
all the time moving unobserved with the 
party waiting on Salya and his soldiers, at 
once took this opportunity to present 
himself 
before 
Salya, 
and 
say 
how 
honored he felt at Salya's acceptance of 
the Kaurava hospitality.  
This amazed Salya whom till then had no 
suspicion of the truth, and he was also 
touched by the chivalry of Duryodhana in 
lavishing kingly hospitality on a partisan 
of the Pandavas. 
Greatly moved, he exclaimed, "How noble 
and kind of you! How can I repay you?"  
Duryodhana replied: "You and your forces 
should fight on my side. This is the 
reward I ask of you." 
Salya was stunned. 
The Puranas wherein right conduct is 
always 
preached, 
sometimes 
set 
out 
stories 
in 
which 
conduct, 
not 
in 
conformity 
with 
Dharma, 
seems 
condoned. Is it right, one may ask, for 
religious books thus to seem to justify 
wrong?  
A little reflection will enable one to see 
the matter in proper light. It is necessary 
to bring home the fact that even wise, 
good and great men are liable to fall into 
error.  
That is why the Puranas, although ever 
seeking 
to 
instil 
Dharma, 
contain 
narratives to show how in this world even 
good 
people 
sometimes 
sin 
against 
Dharma, as though irresistibly driven to 
do so.  
This is to press home the truth that 
howsoever learned one may be, humility 
and 
constant 
vigilance 
are 
absolutely 
necessary if one wishes to avoid evil. 
Why indeed, did the great authors of our 
epics write about the lapses of Rama in 
the Ramayana and Yudhishthira in the 
Mahabharata? 
Where was the need to make mention of 
them and then labor arguments to explain 
them 
away, 
thereby 
disturbing 
men's 
minds?  
It was not as though others had discovered 
the lapses and Vyasa and Valmiki had to 
defend their heroes. The stories are artistic 
creations in which lapses they impress the 
desired moral. 
The parts dealing with the lapses deeply 
distress the reader's mind and serve as 
solemn warnings of pitfalls, which wait to 
engulf the careless.  
They dispose the mind to humility and 
watchfulness and make it realise the need 
for divine guidance. The modern cinema 
also projects on the screen much that is 
bad and immoral.  
Whatever may be the explanation offered 
by the protagonists of the cinema, evil is 
presented on the screen in an attractive 
fashion that grips people's minds and 
tempts them into the path of wickedness.  
This is not so in the Puranas. Although 
they do point out that even great men now 
and again fell into error and committed 
wrong, the presentation is such as to warn 
the reader and not to allure him into evil 
ways.  
This is the striking difference between our 
epics and the modern talkies, which arises 
from the difference in the character of the 
people who produced them.  
"You are the same unto us both. I must 
mean as much to you as the Pandavas. 
You must agree to come to my aid," said 
Duryodhana. 
Salya answered: "Be it so." Flattered by 
Duryodhana's splendid reception, Salya 
deserted the Pandavas who were entitled 
to his love and esteem and pledged his 
word to fight on Duryodhana's side which 
shows what dangers may lurk in receiving 
the hospitality of kings. 
Feeling that it would not be right to go 
back without meeting Yudhishthira, Salya 
then 
turned 
to 
Duryodhana 
saying: 
"Duryodhana, believe me. I have given 
you my word of honor. I must however 
meet Yudhishthira and tell him what I 
have done." 
"Go, see him and return soon. And do not 
forget 
your 
promise 
to 
me," 
said 
Duryodhana.  
"Good luck to you. Go back to your 
palace. I will not betray you." Saying this, 
Salya went to the city of Upaplavya where 
Yudhishthira was camping. 
The Pandavas received the ruler of Madra 
with great eclat. Nakula and Sahadeva 
were joyous beyond measure to see their 
uncle to whom the Pandavas narrated all 
their hardships and sufferings.  
When they started talking about obtaining 
his help in the war that was impending, 
Salya related to them the story of his 
promise to Duryodhana.  
Yudhishthira saw at once that it had been 
a mistake to take Salya's assistance for 
granted, 
thereby 
letting 
Duryodhana 
forestall them.  
Concealing his disappointment as best he 
could, Yudhishthira addressed Salya thus: 
"Great warrior, you are bound to keep the 
promise you have made to, Duryodhana. 
You are the equal of Vasudeva in battle 
and Karna will have you as his charioteer 
when 
he seeks Arjuna's life in the 
battlefield. Are you going to be the cause 
of Arjuna's death? Or are you going to 
save him then? I know I cannot fairly ask 
this of you. Still I do."  
To which Salya rejoined: "My lad, I have 
been tricked into giving Duryodhana my 
word and I shall be ranged against you in 
battle. But when Karna proceeds to attack 
Arjuna, if I happen to be his charioteer, 
you may take it he will go to battle 
disheartened and Arjuna shall be saved. 
Fear not. The sorrows and insults, which 
were visited on Draupadi and you all, will 
soon be an avenged memory. Henceforth, 
yours will be good luck. No one can 
prevent or alter what has been ordained by 
fate. I have acted wrongly. Bear with me."  
52. VRITRA 
INDRA, the Lord of the three regions, 
was once so drunk with pride that he quite 
forgot the courteous manners and forms 
that the gods had hitherto observed.  
When Brihaspati, preceptor of the gods, 
foremost in all branches of learning, and 
venerated alike by the gods and the 
asuras, came to his court, Indra did not 
rise from his seat to receive the acharya or 
ask him to be seated and failed to do the 
customary honors.  
In his great conceit, Indra persuaded 
himself to believe that the sastras allowed 
him as a king in court the prerogative of 
receiving guests seated. Brihaspati was 
hurt by Indra's discourtesy and, attributing 
it to the arrogance of prosperity, silently 
left the assembly.  
Without the high priest of the gods, the 
court lost in splendor and dignity and 
became an unimpressive gathering.  
Indra soon realized the foolishness of his 
conduct and, sensing trouble for himself 
from the acharya's displeasure, he thought 
to make up with him by falling at his feet 
and asking for forgiveness.  
But this he could not do, because 
Brihaspati had, in his anger, made himself 
invisible. This preyed on Indra's mind.  
With Brihaspati gone, Indra's strength 
began to decline, while that of the asuras 
increased, which encouraged the latter to 
attack the gods. Then Brahma, taking pity 
on the beleaguered gods, advised them to 
take unto themselves a new acharya. 
Said he to them: "You have, through 
Indra's folly, lost Brihaspati. Go now to 
Twashta's son Visvarupa and request that 
noble spirit to be your preceptor and all 
will be well with you." 
Heartened by these words, the gods 
sought the youthful anchorite Visvarupa 
and made their request to him saying: 
"Though young in years, you are well 
versed in the Vedas. Do us the honor of 
being our teacher."  
Visvarupa agreed, to the great advantage 
of the gods for, as a result of his guidance 
and teaching, they were saved from the 
tormenting asuras. 
Visvarupa's, mother was of the asura clan 
of daityas, which caused Indra to regard 
Visvarupa with suspicion. He feared that 
because of his birth, Visvarupa might not 
be quite loyal and his suspicion gradually 
deepened.  
Apprehending danger to himself from this 
descendent of the enemies of the gods, 
Indra sought to entice him into error with 
the temptresses of his court and so weaken 
him spiritually. But Visvarupa did not 
succumb. 
The artful and seductive blandishments of 
Indra's glamour girls had no effect on the 
young ascetic. He held fast to his vow of 
celibacy. When Indra found that his plan 
of seduction failed, he gave way to 
murderous thoughts and one day killed 
Visvarupa with the Vajrayudha.  
The story goes that the world suffers 
vicariously for this great sin of Indra. 
And, as a result of it, parts of the earth 
turned alkaline and became unsuitable for 
cultivation 
and 
women 
came 
to 
be 
afflicted with the physical troubles and 
uncleanness 
peculiar 
to 
them. 
The 
frothing of water is also attributed to this. 
Twashta in his great rage and grief at 
Indra's cruel killing of his son and, 
desirous of avenging his death, performed 
a great sacrifice. And out of the sacrificial 
flames 
sprang 
Indra's 
mortal 
enemy 
Vritra.  
Twashta sent him against the chief of the 
gods, saying: "Enemy of Indra, may you 
be strong and may you kill Indra." A great 
battle raged between the two in which 
Vritra was gaining the upper hand. 
When the battle was going against Indra, 
the rishis and the gods sought refuge in 
great Vishnu who offered them protection 
and said to them: "Be not afraid. I shall 
enter Indra's Vajrayudha and he will win 
the battle in the end." And they returned in 
good heart.  
They went to Vritra and said to him: 
"Please make friends with Indra. You are 
both equal in strength and valor."  
Vritra 
respectfully 
answered: 
"O 
blameless ones, how can Indra, and I 
become 
friends? 
Forgive 
me. 
There 
cannot be friendship between rivals for 
supremacy. Two great powers cannot 
coexist as you know." 
The rishis said in reply: "Do not entertain 
such doubts. Two good souls can be 
friends and their friendship is often after 
hostility." 
Vritra yielded saying: "Well, then, I shall 
cease fighting. But I have no faith in 
Indra. He might take me unawares. So I 
seek this boon of you, namely, that neither 
by day nor by night, neither with dry 
weapons nor with wet ones, neither with 
stone nor with wood, nor with metals, nor 
with arrows shall Indra be able to take my 
life."  
"So be it," said the rishis and the gods.  
Hostilities ceased. But soon Vritra's fears 
were 
confirmed. 
Indra 
only 
feigned 
friendship for Vritra but was, all the time, 
waiting for a suitable opportunity to slay 
him.  
One evening, he met Vritra on the beach 
and began to attack him in the twilight. 
The battle had raged for a long while 
when Vritra praising the Lord Vishnu, 
said to Indra: "Meanest of the mean, why 
do you not use the unfailing Vajrayudha? 
Hallowed by Hari, use it against me and I 
shall attain blessedness through Hari."  
Indra maimed Vritra by chopping off his 
right arm but, undaunted, the latter hurled 
with his left band, his iron mace at his 
assailant who thereupon cut down his 
other arm also. When Indra disappeared 
into the mouth of Vritra, great was the 
consternation of the gods.  
But Indra was not dead. He ripped Vritra's 
belly open and issuing forth went to the 
nearby 
beach. 
And 
directing 
his 
thunderbolt at the water hurled it so that 
the surf flew and hit Vritra. Vishnu having 
entered the foam, it became a deadly 
weapon and the mighty Vritra lay dead. 
The long battle thus ended and the 
afflicted world heaved a sigh of relief. But 
to Indra himself, the end of the war 
brought 
only 
ignominy 
because 
his 
victory was secured through sin and deceit 
and is went into hiding for sheer shame.  
Indra's disappearance caused the gods and 
the rishis great distress. For a people 
without a king or a council of state to 
govern them cannot prosper. So they went 
to the good and mighty king Nahusha and 
offered him the crown.  
"Forgive me, I cannot be your king. Who 
am I to aspire to the seat of Indra? How 
can I protect you? It is impossible," he 
humbly 
objected. 
But 
they 
insisted, 
saying: "Do not hesitate. Be anointed our 
king. All the merit and potency of our 
penance will be yours and be an addition 
to your strength. The power and the 
energy of everyone you set your eyes on 
shall be transferred to you and you will be 
invincible." 
Thus 
over-powered, 
he 
agreed. Revolution is no new thing. This 
story shows that, even in the world of the 
gods, there was a revolution leading to 
Indra's 
dethronement 
and 
Nahusha's 
installation as king in his stead. The story 
of Nahusha's fall is also instructive.  
53. NAHUSHA 
THE sin of the unrighteous slaughter of 
Vritra pulled Indra down from his high 
estate and made him a fugitive. Nahusha 
became the king of the gods in his stead. 
Nahusha started well, assisted by the merit 
and the fame earned by him while he was 
a king on earth. Thereafter, he fell on evil 
days.  
The assumption of the kingship of the 
gods filled him with arrogance, He lost his 
humility and became filled with lawless 
desires. 
Nahusha indulged freely in the pleasures 
of heaven and gave him up to untamed 
and lecherous thoughts. One day, he saw 
Indra's wife and became enamored of her. 
Possessed by evil thoughts, he spoke in 
tones of command to the assembled gods: 
"Why has not Sachidevi, the wife of the 
king of the gods, come to me? Am I not 
the king of the gods now? Send her to my 
house soon."  
When she learnt this, Indra's wife was 
indignant. In fear and distress, she went to 
Brihaspati and cried out: "Preceptor, save 
me from this wicked person."  
Brihaspati offered her protection. "Fear 
not " he said, "Indra will soon be back. 
Stay here with me. You will regain your 
husband." 
When 
Nahusha 
learnt 
that 
Sachidevi did not agree to fall in with his 
wishes and that she sought and obtained 
shelter under Brihaspati's roof, he became 
exceedingly angry.  
The 
king's 
displeasure 
frightened 
the 
gods. They protested: "King of the gods, 
be not angry. Your anger will make the 
world sad. Sachidevi is another's wife, do 
not covet her. Do not swerve from the 
path of righteousness." 
But, the infatuated Nahusha would not 
listen to them. Tauntingly, he said to 
them: "When Indra lusted for Ahalya, 
where 
were 
your 
principles 
of 
righteousness and good conduct? Why did 
you not prevent him then and why do you 
stop me now? What did you do when he 
so shamelessly murdered Visvarupa when 
the latter was in penance and where was 
your virtuous horror when he killed Vritra 
through deceit? Sachidevi's only course is 
to come and live with me and it will be for 
your good to get her reconciled to my 
proposal and leave her in my charge. So, 
now set about it," ordered Nahusha.  
The affrighted gods decided to talk the 
matter over with Brihaspati and somehow 
contrive to bring Sachidevi to Nahusha. 
They all went to Brihaspati and related to 
him what Nahusha had said and pleaded 
that Sachidevi should submit to Nahusha’s 
desires.  
At which, the chaste Sachidevi shook with 
shame and fear and cried out: "My God! I 
cannot do it. I sought refuge in you. Oh 
brahmana, do protect me." 
Brihaspati consoled her and said: "He, 
who betrays one who has sought refuge, 
will meet with destruction. The very earth 
will not let the seed, that he sows, sprout. 
I will not give you up. Nahusha's end is 
approaching. Be not afraid."  
He indicated a way of escape from her 
difficult 
situation 
by 
hinting 
that 
she 
should pray for time, and the shrewd 
Sachidevi took the hint and bravely went 
to Nahusha's palace. 
As soon as Nahusha saw her, pride and 
lust having deprived him of his senses, he 
was beside himself with joy and said: "O 
fair one, do not tremble. I am the lord of 
the three regions. There can be no sin in 
your becoming my wife."  
Hearing the wicked man's words, the 
virtuous Indrani, Indra's wife, trembled for 
a moment. Soon regaining composure she 
replied: "King of the gods, before I 
become yours, I have a request to make. Is 
Indra alive or is he dead? If he is alive, 
where is he? If, after making enquiries 
and searching for him, I do not find him, 
then no sin will attach to me and I could 
become 
your 
wife 
with 
a 
clear 
conscience."  
Nahusha said: "What you say is right. Go 
and search for him and be sure to return. 
Remember the plighted word." Saying 
this, he sent her back to Brihaspati's 
house.  
The gods went to the great Vishnu and 
complained to him of Nahusha. They said: 
"Lord, it was your might that killed Vritra 
but Indra bears, the sin of it, and ashamed 
and afraid to show himself in his unclean 
state, he has hidden himself.  
Pray indicate a way of deliverance for 
him." Narayana said in reply: "Let him 
worship me. He will be cleansed of sin 
and the evil-minded Nahusha will meet 
with destruction." 
Sachidevi prayed to the goddess of 
chastity, and, by her grace, reached where 
Indra was in hiding. Indra had reduced 
himself to the size of an atom and hid 
himself in a fibre of the stem of a lotus 
plant growing in Manasarovara. He was 
doing penance in that state waiting for 
better days. Sachidevi could not contain 
herself for sorrow at her husband's plight 
and burst into tears. She acquainted him 
with her troubles.  
Indra spoke words of courage to her. 
"Nahusha's end is drawing near," he said. 
"Go to him by yourself and tell him that 
you consent to his proposal. Ask him to 
come to your residence in a palanquin 
carried by ascetics. Then Nahusha will be 
destroyed." 
Sachidevi went and pretended to agree to 
Nahusha's proposal as Indra had asked her 
to do. Overjoyed that she had returned to 
him in this complaisant mood, the foolish 
Nahusha burst out: "Blessed one, I am 
your slave and ready to do you’re every 
bidding. You have been true to your 
word."  
"Yes, I have come back. You will be my 
husband. I want you to do something, 
which I very much desire. Are you not the 
lord of the world? It is my wish that you 
should come majestically to my house in a 
grander style than the great Vishnu or 
Rudra or the asuras. Let the palanquin be 
borne by the seven rishis. I shall then be 
glad and receive you and bid you 
welcome," she said. 
Nahusha fell into the trap. "What a grand 
idea! Your imagination is wonderful. It 
pleases me exceedingly. It is but proper 
that the great rishis should carry me, who 
am blessed with the powers of absorbing 
the energy of those on whom my eyes fall. 
I 
shall 
do 
exactly 
as 
you 
have 
wished,"said he, and sent her back home. 
The infatuated Nahusha called the rishis 
and bade them carry him on their 
shoulders.  
At this sacrilege, the three worlds were 
aghast and trembled. But worse was to 
come as the palanquin was carried along. 
Inflamed with thoughts of the beautiful 
Sachidevi waiting for him, Nahusha was 
impatient to reach her soon. So he began 
goading the rishi-bearers of his palanquin 
to go faster. And he went so far in his mad 
wickedness as to kick Agastya, one of the 
bearers, saying "sarpa, sarpa." (Sarpa 
means to move and also a serpent.) The 
insanity of lust and arrogance had reached 
its culmination. Nahusha's cup of iniquity 
was full.  
"Meanest of the mean, do thou fall from 
heaven and become a sarpa on earth," 
cursed the rishi in his wrath. Immediately 
Nahusha 
fell 
headlong, 
down 
from 
heaven, and became a python in the jungle 
and had to wait for several thousand years 
for his deliverance. Indra was restored to 
his state. He became the king of the gods 
and Sachidevi's grief ended. 
Relating this story of the sufferings of 
Indra and his wife to Yudhishthira and 
Draupadi at Upaplavya, their uncle Salya 
tried to comfort them.  
"Victory awaits the patient. Those, whom 
prosperity makes arrogant, meet with 
destruction. 
You, 
your 
brothers 
and 
Draupadi 
have 
gone 
through 
untold 
sufferings like Indra and his wife. Your 
trials will soon be over and you will 
regain your kingdom. The evil-minded 
Karna and Duryodhana will be destroyed 
even as Nahusha was," said Salya. 
54. SANJAYA'S MISSION 
THE 
Pandavas 
were 
camping 
at 
Upaplavya 
in 
Virata's 
territory. 
From 
there, they sent emissaries to all friendly 
rulers. Contingents arrived from all parts 
of the country and soon, the Pandavas had 
a mighty force of seven divisions. The 
Kauravas did likewise and collected an 
army of eleven divisions. 
Then, as now, a division was made up of 
all arms grouped together in accordance 
with established military practice. In those 
days, a division consisted of 21,870 
chariots, an equal number of elephants, 
thrice as many horses and five times as 
many 
foot 
soldiers, 
and 
they 
were 
provided with weapons of all kinds and 
other war equipment.  
Chariots were the "armored cars" of 
ancient warfare and elephants, specially 
trained for war, corresponded to the " 
tanks" of modern times.  
Drupada's brahmana messenger reached 
Dhritarashtra's 
court. 
After 
the 
usual 
ceremonial 
introduction 
and 
enquiries 
were over, the messenger addressed the 
assembled gathering on behalf of the 
Pandavas: 
"Law is eternal and of inherent validity. 
You know this and I need not point it out 
to you. Dhritarashtra and Pandu are both 
Vichitravirya's sons and are, according to 
our 
usages, 
equally 
entitled 
to 
their 
father's 
property. 
In 
spite 
of 
this, 
Dhritarashtra's sons have taken possession 
of the whole kingdom, while Pandu's sons 
are without their share of the common 
inheritance. There can be no justification 
for this. Scions of the Kuru dynasty, the 
Pandavas desire peace. They are prepared 
to 
forget 
the 
sufferings 
they 
have 
undergone and to let bygones be bygones. 
They are unwilling to resort to war, 
because they fully know that war never 
brings any good but only destruction. 
Render unto them, therefore, the things 
that are due to them. This would be in 
accordance both with justice and with the 
agreement previously reached. Let there 
be no delay." 
After this appeal of the messenger, the 
wise and brave Bhishma spoke. "By the 
grace of God," he said, "the Pandavas are 
safe 
and 
well. 
Although 
they 
have 
obtained the support of many princes and 
are strong enough for battle, they are not 
bent on war. They still seek peace. To 
restore to them their property is the only 
right thing to do." 
Bhishma had not finished when Karna 
angrily broke in and, turning to the 
messenger, exclaimed: "O brahmana, is 
there anything new in what you have said? 
What tortures it to tell the same old story? 
How can Yudhishthira claim the property 
that he lost at the game board? If, now, 
Yudhishthira wants anything, he must beg 
for it as a gift! He arrogantly prefers this 
absurd claim in fond reliance on the 
strength of his allies, particularly Matsya 
and Panchala. Let me tell you clearly that 
nothing can be got out of Duryodhana by 
threats. As the plighted word, that the 
Pandavas should live undiscovered during 
the thirteenth year, has been broken, they 
must once again go back to the forest for 
another 
twelve 
years 
and 
return 
thereafter."  
Bhishma interposed: "Son of Radha, you 
speak foolishly. If we do not do as this 
messenger tells us, war will be upon us in 
which we are certain to be defeated. And 
Duryodhana and all of us are doomed to 
destruction." The disorder and excitement 
in 
the 
assembly 
made 
Dhritarashtra 
intervene.  
He said to the messenger: "Having in 
mind 
the 
good 
of 
the 
world 
and 
considering the Pandava's welfare, I have 
decided to send Sanjaya to them. Please 
return at once and tell Yudhishthira this."  
Then Dhritarashtra called Sanjaya aside 
and instructed him thus: "Sanjaya, go to 
the sons of Pandu and convey to them my 
affectionate regards and my kind inquiries 
about Krishna, Satyaki and Virata. Give 
all 
the 
princes 
assembled 
there 
my 
regards. Go there on my behalf and speak 
conciliatingly 
so 
as 
to 
secure 
the 
avoidance of war."  
Sanjaya went to Yudhishthira on this 
mission of peace. After the introductory 
salutations, 
Sanjaya 
thus 
addressed 
Yudhishthira in the midst of his court: 
"Dharmaputra, it is my good fortune to be 
able to see you again with my eyes. 
Surrounded by princes, you present the 
picture 
of 
Indra 
himself. 
The 
sight 
gladdens my heart. King Dhritarashtra 
sends you his best wishes and desires to 
know that you are well and happy. The 
son of Ambika (Dhritarashtra) detests all 
talk of war. He desires your friendship 
and yearns for peace."  
When Dharmaputra heard Sanjaya say 
this, he felt glad and answered: "If so, 
Dhritarashtra's sons have been saved, nay, 
we have all escaped a great tragedy. I, too, 
desire only peace and hate war. If our 
kingdom is returned to us, we will wipe 
out all memories of the sufferings we have 
undergone." 
Sanjaya spoke again: "Dhritarashtra's sons 
are perverse. Disregarding their father's 
advice and their grandsire's wise words, 
they are still as wicked as ever. But you 
should not lose patience. Yudhishthira, 
you stand ever for right conduct. Let us 
eschew the great evil of war. Can 
happiness be gained with possessions 
obtained through war? What good can we 
reap from a kingdom won after killing our 
own 
relatives? 
Do 
not 
therefore 
commence hostilities. Even if one were to 
gain the whole earth bounded by the 
ocean, old age and death are inescapable. 
Duryodhana and his brothers are fools. 
But that is no reason why you should 
swerve from rectitude or lose patience. 
Even if they do not give back your 
kingdom, you should not abandon the 
supreme path of dharma."  
Yudhishthira 
answered: 
"Sanjaya, 
what 
you say is true. Rectitude is the best of 
possessions, 
but 
are 
we 
committing 
wrong? Krishna knows the intricacies of 
rectitude and dharma. He wishes both 
sides well. I shall do as Vasudeva orders." 
Krishna said: "I desire the welfare of the 
Pandavas. I desire also that Dhritarashtra 
and his sons should be happy. This is a 
difficult matter. I think I can settle this 
issue by myself going to Hastinapura. If I 
could obtain peace from the Kauravas on 
terms that do not conflict with the welfare 
of all, nothing would make me and the 
Pandavas happier. If I succeed in doing 
so, the Kauravas will have been rescued 
from the jaws of death. I shall also have 
achieved something good and worthwhile. 
Even if, through a peaceful settlement, the 
Pandavas get back what is due to them, 
they will still serve Dhritarashtra loyally. 
They desire nothing else. But they are also 
prepared for war if need be. Of these two 
alternatives, peace and war, Dhritarashtra 
can choose what he pleases."  
And 
Yudhishthira 
said 
to 
Sanjaya: 
"Sanjaya, go back to the Kaurava, court 
and tell the son of Ambika this from me: 
'Was it not through your generosity that 
we obtained a share of the kingdom when 
we were young? You, who made me a 
king once, should not deny us our share 
now and drive us to make a beggar's 
living on the charity of others. Dear uncle, 
there is enough room in the world for both 
of us and the Kauravas. Let there be no 
antagonism, therefore, between us.' Thus 
should you request Dhritarashtra on my 
behalf. Give the grandsire my love and 
regards and ask him to devise some way 
of ensuring that his grandchildren live 
happily 
in 
amity. 
Convey 
the 
same 
message to Vidura also. Vidura is the 
person who can best see what is good for 
all of us and advise accordingly. Explain 
matters to Duryodhana and tell him on my 
behalf: 'My dear brother, you made us, 
who were princes of the realm, live in the 
forest, clad in skins. You insulted and 
harassed 
our 
weeping 
wife 
in 
the 
assembly of princes. We bore all this 
patiently. Give us back, at least now, what 
is lawfully ours. Do not covet what 
belongs to others. We are five. For the 
five of us give at least five villages and 
make peace with us. We shall be content. 
Say thus to Duryodhana, Sanjaya. I am 
prepared and ready for peace as well as 
for war." 
After Yudhishthira had said these words, 
Sanjaya took leave of Kesava and the 
Pandavas, and went back to Hastinapura. 
55. NOT A NEEDLE-POINT OF 
TERRITORY 
AFTER he had despatched Sanjaya to the 
Pandavas, 
Dhritarashtra, 
filled 
with 
anxiety, could not get a wink of sleep that 
night. He sent for Vidura and spent the 
whole night talking to him. 
"To give the Pandavas their share of the 
kingdom is the safest plan," said Vidura. 
"Only this can bring good to both sides. 
Treat the Pandavas and your own sons 
with equal affection. In this case, the right 
course is also the wise one." 
Vidura counselled Dhritarashtra in this 
manner at great length. 
The next morning Sanjaya returned to 
Hastinapura. And gave a full account of 
what had taken place in Yudhishthira's 
court. 
"Chiefly, Duryodhana should know what 
Arjuna said: 'Krishna and I are going to 
destroy Duryodhana and his followers, 
root and branch. Make no mistake about 
it. The Gandiva bow is impatient for war. 
My bowstring is throbbing even without 
my stretching it and from my quiver, 
arrows 
keep 
peeping 
out 
impatiently, 
demanding when? When? Sanjaya, evil 
stars make the foolish Duryodhana seek 
war with Krishna and myself. Not even 
Indra and the gods can defeat us.' Thus 
spoke Dhananjaya," said Sanjaya.  
Bhishma counselled Dhritarashtra against 
opposing the combined might of Arjuna 
and 
Krishna. 
"Karna, 
who 
boasts 
repeatedly that he will slay the Pandavas", 
said Bhishma, "is not equal to a sixteenth 
part of the Pandavas. Your sons are 
heading for destruction, listening to his 
words. When Arjuna beat back your son's 
attack on Virata's capital and humbled his 
pride, what was Karna able to do? When 
the Gandharvas took your son prisoner, 
where did the invincible Karna bide 
himself? Was it not Arjuna who drove 
back the Gandharvas?" Thus did Bhisma 
taunt Karna and warn the Kauravas.  
"What grandfather Bhisma says is the 
only 
proper 
thing 
to 
do," 
said 
Dhritarashtra. "All wise men say, and I 
know, that it is best to seek peace. But 
what can I do? These fools would go their 
own way, however loudly I protest."  
Duryodhana, who had been listening to all 
this, stood up. "Father, do not worry and 
tremble about our safety. We know how 
strong we are. That we shall win is 
certain. Yudhishthira knows it too, for, 
giving up all hope of kingdom, he only 
begs now for five villages. Is it not clear 
from this that he is already scared about 
our 
eleven 
divisions? 
What 
can 
the 
Pandavas oppose to our eleven divisions? 
Why then do you doubt our victory?" 
Duryodhana said to his father and tried to 
cheer him up. 
"My son, let us not have war," said 
Dhritarashtra. "Be satisfied with half the 
kingdom. It is enough if we govern that 
half well." Duryodhana could stand it no 
longer. "The Pandavas will not receive 
even a needle-point of territory," he 
exclaimed, and left the court. In the 
excitement that prevailed, the court broke 
up. 
Let us now relate what the Pandavas were 
saying among themselves. After Sanjaya 
left 
Upaplavya 
for 
Hastinapura, 
Yudhishthira said to Krishna: "Vasudeva, 
Sanjaya is Dhritarashtra's alter ego. From 
his speech, I have divined what is in 
Dhritarashtra's 
mind. 
Dhritarashtra 
is 
trying to secure peace without giving us 
any territory. In my simplicity, I was glad 
at first when I heard Sanjaya speak. But it 
soon became clear that my joy was 
unfounded. He then struck a middle line 
and spoke desiring peace. But the words 
with which he ended his message seemed 
to commend meekness to us, even if our 
just rights were denied. Dhritarashtra has 
not been playing fair with us. The crisis is 
approaching. There are none but you to 
protect us. I made my offer that we would 
be content with only five villages. The 
wicked Kauravas will refuse even this. 
How can we tolerate this height of 
intransigence? Only you can advise us in 
this crisis. There is none but you who 
knows what our duty is now and can 
guide us in dharma as well as in 
statesmanship."  
Krishna said in reply: "For the good of 
you both, I have decided to go to 
Hastinapura. I shall go to Dhritarashtra's 
court and try to secure your rights without 
war. If my mission succeeds, it will be for 
the good of the world." 
Yudhishthira said: "Krishna, pray do not 
go. What is the good of your going to the 
enemies' 
place 
now? 
The 
perverse 
Duryodhana will stick to his folly. I do not 
like your going among those unscrupulous 
men. We cannot let you jeopardise your 
safety, for the Kauravas will stop at 
nothing."  
Krishna answered: "Dharmaputra, I know 
how wicked Duryodhana is. But still we 
should make all attempts at a peaceful 
solution so as to give the world no cause 
to 
accuse 
us 
of 
not 
having 
done 
everything possible to avert war. We must 
omit nothing, no matter how slender our 
hopes of success. Have no fears for my 
safety, for, if the Kauravas offer me, a 
messenger of peace, any threat of bodily 
harm, I will reduce them to ashes." 
Said Yudhishthira: "You are all-knowing. 
You know our hearts as well as theirs. In 
expounding matters and in the art of 
persuasion, there is none better than you." 
Krishna said: "Yes, I know you both. 
Your mind ever clings to righteousness 
and theirs is always steeped in hatred, 
jealousy and enmity. I will do all I can to 
secure the result, which I know is dear to 
you, a settlement reached without war 
even though it may have, but little for 
you. The signs are ominous and portend 
war. Still duty demands that we should 
make the attempt for peace." 
Thus saying, Krishna took leave of the 
Pandavas and set off in his chariot to 
Hastinapura. 
56. KRISHNA'S MISSION 
SATYAKI 
accompanied 
Govinda 
(Krishna) to Hastinapura. Before setting 
out on his journey, Krishna had a lone 
discussion with the Pandavas. Even the 
mighty 
Bhima, 
rather 
surprisingly, 
supported a peaceful settlement.  
"Let not the race be destroyed. Peace is 
very much to be preferred," said he. The 
poet Vyasa makes Bhima speak thus in 
order to show that truly great warriors 
desire peace, and that to seek peace is not 
a sign of fear. 
But 
Draupadi 
could 
not 
forget 
her 
humiliation. Holding her locks in her hand 
she stood before Krishna, and in a voice 
quivering 
with 
grief, 
she 
said: 
"Madhusudana, look at these tresses of 
mine and do what honor requires to be 
done. There can be no peace with honor. 
Even if Arjuna and Bhima are against 
war, my father, old though he is, will go 
to battle, supported by my children. Even 
if my father can keep out, my children, 
with Subhadra's son Abhimanyu, at their 
head, will fight the Kauravas. I have, for 
the sake of Dharmaputra, these thirteen 
years, suppressed the burning flame of 
anger within me. I can restrain myself no 
longer." And she sobbed, remembering 
the great outrage.  
Krishna was moved and said: "Weep not. 
Dhritarashtra's sons will not listen to my 
words of peace. They are going to fall and 
their bodies will be food for wild dogs and 
jackals. You will live to see us victorious 
and the insult to you will be fully 
avenged, and that too, soon." Draupadi 
was satisfied.  
Madhava (Krishna) halted for the night 
near the city of Kucasthala. When news of 
Krishna's forthcoming visit came, the city 
was in great excitement.  
Dhritarashtra issued orders for decorating 
the city and arrangements for receiving 
Janardana (Krishna) were in full swing. 
Dhritarashtra 
issued 
instructions 
that 
Duhsasana's palace, being bigger and 
more beautiful than Duryodhana's, should 
be got ready and placed at the disposal of 
Krishna and his entourage and large tents 
were erected at several places outside the 
city, along the route which Krishna's 
chariot was to take. 
Dhritarashtra consulted Vidura. He said to 
him: "Make arrangements for presenting 
Govinda 
with 
chariots 
and 
elephants. 
Presents of other kinds should also be got 
ready." But Vidura said:  
"Govinda cannot be bought with presents. 
Give him that for which he is coming to 
the land of the Kurus. Does he not come 
here seeking a peaceful settlement? Make 
that possible. You cannot satisfy Madhava 
with other gifts." 
When Govinda reached Hastinapura, the 
citizens had thronged in such numbers in 
the decorated streets that his chariot could 
only progress very slowly. He went first 
to 
Dhritarashtra's 
palace 
and 
then 
proceeded to Vidura's house. Kuntidevi 
met him there.  
Thinking of the sufferings of her sons and 
overpowered by grief, she wept. Krishna 
comforted her and, taking leave of her, 
made for Duryodhana's palace.  
Duryodhana gave Govinda welcome and 
invited him to dinner, but Krishna said 
with a smile: "Emissaries eat only after 
their mission is fulfilled. You may give a 
feast when my work here is completed."  
Declining 
Duryodhana's 
invitation, 
he 
returned to Vidura's house where he 
rested. 
Vidura and Krishna took counsel together. 
Vidura 
told 
him 
that 
Duryodhana's 
arrogance was based on his confidence 
that no one could defeat him as long as 
Bhishma and Drona, who, he knew, were 
under a moral obligation not to abandon 
him, stood by him. 
Vidura said that it would be a mistake for 
Govinda even to enter the wicked man's 
court. All, who knew Duryodhana and his 
brothers, apprehended that they would 
plot, through fraud and deceit, against 
Krishna's life.  
"What you say about Duryodhana is true. 
I have not come here with any hope that I 
would be able to secure a peaceful 
settlement, but only in order that the 
world might not hold me to blame. Have 
no fear for my life," said Krishna.  
The 
next 
morning, 
Duryodhana 
and 
Sakuni came to Krishna and informed him 
that Dhritarashtra was waiting for him. 
Govinda went to the court along with 
Vidura.  
As Vasudeva came into the court, that 
great assemblage of kings stood up. 
Saluting the elders with folded hands and 
with a word or a smile for the others, 
Krishna took his seat. The introductions 
over, Govinda rose from his seat and, 
turning 
to 
Dhritarashtra 
explained 
the 
object of his visit. He made clear what the 
Pandavas wanted.  
"Dhritarashtra, do not bring ruin to your 
people. You regard as bad what is good 
for you and as good what is bad. It is your 
duty to restrain your sons. The Pandavas 
are prepared for war but they desire peace. 
They wish to live in happiness under you. 
Treat them also as your sons and devise 
an honorable solution, and the world will 
acclaim you," said Krishna. 
Dhritarashtra said: "My friends know that 
I am not to blame. I desire precisely what 
Madhava has stated but I am powerless. 
My wicked sons do not listen to me. 
Krishna, 
I 
entreat 
you 
to 
advise 
Duryodhana." 
Krishna turned to Duryodhana and said: 
"You are the descendant of a noble line. 
Pursue the path of dharma. Your present 
thoughts are unworthy and befit only men 
of low birth. On account of you, this 
famous 
line 
is 
in 
danger 
of 
being 
destroyed. If you listen to reason and 
justice, 
the 
Pandavas 
themselves 
will 
install Dhritarashtra as king and you as the 
heir apparent. Make peace with them by 
giving them half the kingdom." 
Bhishma 
and 
Drona 
also 
pressed 
Duryodhana to listen to Govinda. But 
Duryodhana's heart could not be softened. 
"I pity Dhritarashtra and Gandhari whom 
Duryodhana is dooming to bereavement 
and desolation by his misdeeds," said 
Vidura. 
Dhritarashtra once again said to his son: 
"If you do not listen to Govinda's advice, 
our race will perish." 
Drona and Bhishma also tried repeatedly 
to persuade Duryodhana and turn him 
from error. Duryodhana was furious with 
everyone for pressing him in this matter to 
agree to a peaceful solution. He rose, and 
said: 
"Madhusudana, you wrong me out of love 
for the Pandavas. The others here also 
blame me, but I do not think I am one 
whit 
to 
blame 
in 
this 
matter. 
The 
Pandavas, of their own volition, staked 
their kingdom at play and, being defeated, 
justly forfeited it. How am I responsible 
for it? Losing the game, they went to the 
forests as in honor bound. For what fault 
of mine do they now seek battle and wish 
to slay us? I will not yield to threats. 
When I was young, the elders did us 
grievous wrong by giving the Pandavas, I 
do not know why, a part of the kingdom 
to which they had not a shadow of a right. 
I acquiesced then but they lost it at play. I 
refuse to return it to them. I am utterly 
blameless. I will not give the Pandavas an 
inch of land, not even a needle-point of 
it!" 
When Duryodhana said that he had not 
committed wrong, Govinda laughed and 
said: "The play was fraudulently arranged 
by you in conspiracy with Sakuni and you 
afterwards 
insulted 
Draupadi 
in 
an 
assembly of princes. And yet, you have 
the impudence to say that you have 
committed no wrong," and reminded him 
of the other iniquities he had perpetrated 
against the Pandavas. 
Duhsasana seeing that Bhishma and others 
were accepting Krishna's indictment of 
Duryodhana said: "Brother, it seems that 
these people have a plot to bind you with 
ropes and hand you over to the Pandavas. 
Let 
us 
get 
away 
from 
here," 
and 
Duryodhana, 
accompanied 
by 
his 
brothers, walked out of the court.  
Govinda addressed the court again and 
said: "Sires, the Yadavas and Vrishnis live 
happily, now that Kamsa and Sisupala are 
dead. In order to save a whole people, it is 
some times necessary to sacrifice an 
individual. 
Does 
it 
not 
happen 
occasionally that a village is abandoned in 
order that the country may be saved? I am 
afraid 
you 
will 
have 
to 
sacrifice 
Duryodhana if you want to save your race. 
That is the only way."  
Dhritarashtra said to Vidura: "Bring far-
sighted Gandhari here. It is possible that 
Duryodhana 
might 
listen 
to 
her." 
Gandhari was sent for and, when she 
came to the court, Duryodhana was sent 
for.  
Duryodhana, his eyes red with anger, 
returned and Gandhari tried by all the 
means in her power to bring him round to 
reason. Duryodhana said 'No' and again 
walked out of the hall.  
He and his friends had plotted to seize 
Krishna. News of this reached the court. 
Govinda, who had anticipated all this, 
laughed and disclosed his divinity.  
The blind Dhritarashtra, by the grace of 
Krishna, temporarily regained his sight 
and was able to see Krishna in his 
Visvarupa presence in every form.  
"Pundarikaksha, 
(lotus-eyed 
Krishna) 
having seen your Visvarupa, I do not wish 
to see anything else. I ask that I should be 
blind again," said Dhritarashtra, and he 
became blind again. "All our efforts have 
failed. 
Duryodhana 
is 
obstinate," 
said 
Dhritarashtra to Govinda.  
And Krishna rose and, with Satyaki and 
Vidura on either side of him, left the 
court.  
He went straight to Kunti. He told her 
what had happened and she asked him to 
convey her blessings to her sons.  
"The time has come," said she, "for that 
for which a kshatriya woman brings forth 
sons. May you protect my sons!"  
A kshatriya mother brings forth children 
to be sacrificed in war. Purushottamat 
(Krishna as Supreme Being) got into his 
chariot and sped towards Upaplavya. War 
became a certainty. 
57. ATTACHMENT AND DUTY 
ANY ray of hope there might have been 
of a peaceful settlement when Krishna 
went to Hastinapura was extinguished 
when he returned and narrated what 
happened. Kunti was overwhelmed with 
grief when she learnt that it was to be war 
to the death. 
"How can I" reflected Kunti, "give my 
thoughts tongue and say to my sons, 'Bear 
the insults. Let us not ask for any territory 
and let us avoid war'? How can my sons 
accept what is contrary to kshatriya 
tradition?" 
"At the same time," she thought, "what 
can be gained by mutual killings in the 
war and what happiness attained after the 
destruction of the race? How shall I face 
this dilemma?" Thus was she tormented 
by the prospect of wholesale destruction 
on the one hand and the claims of 
kshatriya honor on the other.  
"How can my sons defeat the mighty three 
combined, Bhishma, Drona and Karna? 
They are warriors who have never yet met 
defeat. When I think of them, my mind 
trembles. I do not worry about the others. 
These three are the only people in the 
Kaurava army capable of fighting the 
Pandavas with any hope of slaying them. 
Of these, Dronacharya might refrain from 
killing my children from either love or 
unwillingness to meet one's own disciples 
in battle. The grandsire will certainly not 
want to kill them. But Karna is the 
Pandavas' chief enemy. He is anxious to 
please Duryodhana by killing my sons. 
Karna is a great man-at-arms. As I think 
of him engaged in battle against my other 
sons, my heart is consumed with agony 
like a faggot in the fire. Now is the time 
for me, to seek Karna out and tell him the 
truth about his birth, on knowing which, 
he is bound to abandon Duryodhana's 
cause." 
Tormented by these anxious thoughts 
about her children. Kunti went to the 
banks of the Ganga where Karna usually 
offered his daily prayers.  
Karna was there at his devotions. Facing 
east and with uplifted hands he was in 
deep 
meditations. 
Kunti quietly stood 
behind him and waited.  
Karna 
was 
in 
meditation 
and 
was 
unmindful of everything until he felt the 
hot rays of the sun on his back. 
His prayers over, Karna looked back to 
find 
Kunti 
standing 
behind 
him 
and 
holding the hem of his upper garment over 
her head to shield it from the burning sun.  
That Pandu's queen and the mother of the 
Pandava princes should be there, waiting 
patiently for him to finish his prayers, 
filled 
him 
with 
great 
confusion 
and 
amazement. 
"The son of Radha and the chariot-driver 
Adhiratha bows to you. I am at your 
service. What can I do for you, O queen?" 
asked Karna, according to the established 
forms of respectful address. 
"Karna," said Kuntidevi, "you are not 
Radha's son, nor is the charioteer your 
father. Do not think that you are a man of 
the chariot-driver's caste. You are Surya's 
son born out of the womb of Pritha of 
royal blood, otherwise known as Kunti. 
May good fortune attend you"!  
She then narrated the story of his birth. 
"You who were born with full armor and 
golden 
earrings," 
said 
Kunti, 
"not 
knowing that the Pandavas are your 
brothers, have joined Duryodhana and 
have come to hate them. To live in 
dependence on Dhritarashtra's sons, does 
not befit you. Join Arjuna and be one of 
the kings of the realm. May you and 
Arjuna put down the wicked! The whole 
world will be at your feet. Your fame will 
reach far and wide, like that of the 
brothers 
Balarama 
and 
Krishna. 
Surrounded by your five brothers, your 
effulgence will be like that of Brahma 
among the gods. In perplexing situations, 
one must do what gives satisfaction to 
loving parents. This is the highest dharma 
according to our scriptures." 
When his mother spoke thus to him at the 
end of his devotions to the sun, Karna felt 
a sign in his heart that the Sun god 
endorsed Kunti's request. But he checked 
himself and took it to mean that the Sun 
god was testing his loyalty and strength of 
mind. He should not be found wanting.  
With an effort of the will, he controlled 
alike the temptations of self-interest and 
the prompting of natural affection. He said 
sadly but firmly: "What you have said, 
dear mother, is contrary to dharma. If I 
swerve from the path of duty, I shall have 
done myself much more hurt than any that 
an enemy might inflict on me in the 
battlefield. You deprived me of all that 
was my birthright as a kshatriya when you 
threw me, a helpless babe, into the river. 
And now, you talk to me of my duties as a 
kshatriya. You denied me the motherly 
love, which blesses all life. And now, 
thinking of your other children's good, 
you tell me this story. If I now join the 
Pandavas, will not the world proclaim that 
I have done so out of fear? I have eaten 
the salt of Dhritarashtra's sons, won their 
confidence as their champion and enjoyed 
all the consideration and kindness they 
showed me. And now you want me, when 
the battle is about to be joined, to be 
untrue to my salt and go over to the 
Pandavas. The sons of Dhritarashtra look 
on me as the ark, which will enable them 
to cross the deluge of war. I have myself 
urged them into this war. How can I now 
desert them? Could there be blacker 
treachery and baser ingratitude? What in 
life, or beyond it, would be worth a price 
like that? Mother dear, I must discharge 
my debt, aye, with life, if necessary; 
otherwise, I shall be no better than a 
common thief purloining my food all 
these years. I shall surely use all my 
followers against your sons in this coming 
war. I cannot deceive you. Please forgive 
me."  
"But yet," continued he, "I cannot have 
my mother plead completely in vain. Part 
with Arjuna to me. Either he or myself 
must die in this war. I will not kill your 
other sons, whatever they may do unto 
me. Mother of warrior sons, you will still 
have five sons. Either I or Arjuna will 
survive this war. And with the other four 
sons, you will still have five".  
When Kunti heard her first-born speak 
thus firmly, adhering to the kshatriya 
code, her heart was full of tumultuous and 
contrary feelings and, without trusting 
herself to speak. She embraced him and 
departed in silence.  
"Who can go against what has been 
ordained?" she thought. "He has, at least, 
offered not to harm four of my sons. That 
is enough. May God bless him," and she 
returned home. 
58. THE PANDAVA 
GENERALISSIMO 
GOVINDA reached Upaplavya and told 
the Pandavas what had happened in 
Hastinapura.  
"I spoke urging what was right and what 
was also good for them. But, it was all in 
vain. There is now no way out except the 
fourth, that is, the last alternative of war. 
The foolish Duryodhana would not listen 
to the advice tendered to him by the elders 
in the assembly. We must now prepare for 
war without delay. Kurukshetra is waiting 
for the holocaust."  
"There is no longer any hope of peace," 
said Yudhishthira, addressing his brothers, 
and issued orders for marshalling their 
forces in, battle array.  
They formed the army in seven divisions 
and 
appointed 
Drupada, 
Virata, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
Sikhandin, 
Satyaki, 
Chekitana and Bhimasena at the head of 
each division. They then considered who 
should be appointed Generalissimo.  
Addressing Sahadeva, Yudhishthira said: 
"We should select one of these seven to be 
Supreme Commander. He should be one 
capable of successfully facing the great 
Bhishma, who can burn enemies to ashes. 
He should be one who knows how to 
dispose 
his 
forces 
as 
circumstances 
require from time to time. Who do you 
think 
is 
most 
fitted 
for 
this 
responsibility?"  
In the olden days, it was the practice to 
ascertain the views of younger people 
first, 
before 
consulting 
elders. 
This 
instilled 
enthusiasm 
and 
self-confidence 
in the younger folk. If the elders were 
consulted first, it would not be possible 
for others to speak with freedom, and 
even honest differences of opinion might 
savor of disrespect.  
"Let us take as our Supreme Commander 
the king of Virata who helped us when we 
lived in disguise and with whose support 
we now demand our share of the 
kingdom," replied Sahadeva. 
"It seems to me best to make Drupada the 
Generalissimo, 
for, 
in 
point 
of 
age, 
wisdom, courage, birth and strength, he is 
supreme," said Nakula.  
"Drupada, the father of Draupadi, has 
learnt archery from Bharadwaja, and has 
for long been waiting for an encounter 
with Drona. He is much respected by all 
kings, and is supporting us, as if we were 
his own sons. He should lead our army 
against Drona and Bhishma."  
Dharmaputra then asked Dhananjaya for 
his 
opinion. 
"I 
think, 
Dhrishtadyumna 
should be our chief in the battlefield. The 
hero who has his senses under control and 
who has been born to bring about Drona's 
end. Dhrishtadyumna alone can withstand 
the arrows of Bhishma whose skill in 
archery made even the great Parasurama 
hold back. He is the only man fitted to be 
our commander. I can think of no one 
else," replied Arjuna.  
Bhimasena said: "O king, what Arjuna 
says is true, but the rishis and elders have 
said that Sikhandin has come into the 
world to kill Bhishma. My inclination 
would be to give the command to 
Sikhandin whose radiant face is like that 
of Parasurama. I do not think any one else 
can defeat Bhishma."  
Yudhishthira finally asked Kesava for his 
opinion. "The warriors mentioned are, 
each one of them, worthy of selection," 
said Krishna. "Any one of them would fill 
the 
Kauravas 
with 
fear. 
All 
things 
considered, I would endorse Arjuna's 
choice. 
Anoint 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
therefore, as your Supreme Commander." 
Accordingly, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
Drupada's 
illustrious son, who led Draupadi at the 
swayamvara and gave her away to Arjuna, 
who for thirteen long years was brooding 
over the insult that his sister had to suffer 
in Duryodhana's court, and who was 
waiting for an opportunity to avenge the 
wrong, 
was 
anointed 
Supreme 
Commander of the Pandava army.  
The lion-roar of warriors, the blowing of 
conchs and shells and the trumpeting of 
elephants rent the air, With warlike cheers 
which made the sky ring, the Pandava 
army 
entered 
Kurukshetra 
in 
martial 
array.  
59. BALARAMA 
BALARAMA, the illustrious brother of 
Krishna, visited the Pandavas, in their 
encampment. 
As 
Halayudha 
(plough 
bearer), 
clad 
in 
blue 
silk, 
entered 
majestically 
like 
a 
lion. 
Yudhishthira, 
Krishna and others gave the broad-
shouldered 
warrior 
a 
glad 
welcome. 
Bowing to Drupada and Virata, the visitor 
seated himself beside Dharmaputra. 
"I have come to Kurukshetra," said he, 
"learning that the descendants of Bharata 
have let themselves be overwhelmed by 
greed, anger and hatred and that the peace 
talks have broken down and that war has 
been declared." 
Overcome by emotion, he paused for a 
while and then continued: "Dharmaputra, 
dreadful destruction is ahead. The earth is 
going to is a bloody morass strewn with 
mangled bodies! It is an evil destiny that 
has maddened the kshatriya world to 
foregather here to meet its doom. Often 
have I told Krishna, 'Duryodhana is the 
same to us as the Pandavas. We may not 
take sides in their foolish quarrels.' He 
would not listen to me. His great affection 
for Dhananjaya has misled Krishna and he 
is with you in this war which I see he has 
approved. How can Krishna and I be in 
opposite 
camps? 
For 
Bhima 
and 
Duryodhana, both of them my pupils, I 
have equal regard and love. How then can 
I support one against the other? Nor can I 
bear to see the Kauravas destroyed. I will 
therefore have nothing to do with this war, 
this 
conflagration 
that 
will 
consume 
everything. This tragedy has made me 
lose all interest in the world and so I shall 
wander among holy places." 
Having thus spoken against the calamitous 
war, Krishna's brother left the place, his 
heart laden with sorrow and his mind 
seeking consolation in God.  
This episode of Balarama’s, keeping out 
of the Mahabharata war is illustrative of 
the perplexing situations in which good 
and honest men often find themselves.  
Compelled to choose between two equally 
justifiable, but contrary, courses of action, 
the unhappy individual is caught on the 
horns of a dilemma. It is only honest men 
that find themselves in this predicament. 
The dishonest ones of the earth have no 
such problems, guided as they are solely 
by their own attachments and desires, that 
is, by self-interest.  
Not so the great men who have renounced 
all desire. Witness the great trials to 
which, 
in 
the 
Mahabharata, 
Bhishma, 
Vidura, Yudhishthira and Karna were put.  
We read in that epic how they solved their 
several difficulties. Their solutions did not 
conform to a single moral pattern but 
reflected their several individualities. The 
conduct of each was the reaction of his 
personality and character to the impact of 
circumstances.  
Modern critics and expositors sometimes 
forget this underlying basic factor and 
seek to weigh all in the same scales, 
which is quite wrong. We may profit by 
the way in which, in the Ramayana, 
Dasaratha, 
Kumbhakarna, 
Maricha, 
Bharata and Lakshmana reacted to the 
difficulties with which each of them was 
faced.  
Likewise, 
Balarama's 
neutrality 
in 
the 
Mahabharata war has a lesson. Only two 
princes kept out of that war. One was 
Balarama and the other was Rukma, the 
ruler of Bhojakata. The story of Rukma, 
whose younger sister Rukmini married 
Krishna, is told in the next chapter.  
60. RUKMINI 
BHISHMAKA, the king of Vidarbha, had 
five sons and an only daughter, Rukmini, 
a princess of matchless beauty, charm and 
strength of character.  
Having heard of Krishna and his renown, 
she wished to be united to him in wedlock 
and the desire daily grew in intensity. Her 
relatives approved the idea, all except her 
eldest brother Rukma, the heir apparent, 
between whom and Krishna there was no 
love lost.  
Rukma pressed his father not to give 
Rukmini in marriage to the ruler of 
Dwaraka but to marry her instead to 
Sisupala, the king of Chedi. The king 
being old, Rukma's became the dominant 
voice and it looked as though Rukmini 
would be compelled to marry Sisupala. 
Rukmini, 
whose 
heart 
was 
wholly 
Krishna's 
because 
she 
was 
Lakshmi 
incarnate, was disconsolate. She feared 
that her father would be helpless against 
her domineering brother and would not be 
able to prevent the unhappy marriage.  
Mustering 
all 
her 
strength 
of 
mind, 
Rukmini resolved somehow to find a way 
out of her predicament. She took counsel 
with a brahmana whom, abandoning all 
maidenly reserve, she sent as her emissary 
to 
Krishna, 
charging 
him 
to 
explain 
matters to her beloved and sue for help. 
The 
brahmana 
accordingly 
went 
toDwaraka and conveyed to Krishna 
Rukmini's sad plight and her entreaty, and 
handed to him the letter Rukmini had sent 
through him. The letter ran as follows: 
"My heart has already accepted you as 
lord and master. I charge you therefore to 
come and succour me before Sisupala 
carries me off by force. The matter cannot 
brook any delay; so you must be here 
tomorrow. Sisupala's forces, as well as 
Jarasandha's, will oppose you and will 
have to be overcome before you can have 
me. May you be the triumphant hero and 
capture me! My brother has decided to 
marry me to Sisupala and, as part of the 
wedding ceremonies, I am going to the 
temple along with my retinue to offer 
worship to Parvati. That would be the best 
time for you to come and rescue me. If 
you do not turn up, I will put an end to my 
life so that I may at least join you in my 
next birth." 
Krishna 
read 
this 
and 
immediately 
mounted his chariot. At the king's behest, 
Kundinapura, the capital of Vidarbha, was 
most 
gorgeously 
decorated 
and 
preparations for the wedding of the 
princess with Sisupala were in full swing.  
The bridegroom elect and his associates, 
all sworn enemies of Krishna, had already 
assembled in the capital. Balarama came 
to know of Krishna's sudden and secret 
departure, all by himself.  
Guessing that it must be about the 
daughter of the king of Vidarbha and 
anxious lest Krishna should be hemmed in 
alone by mortal enemies thirsting for his 
blood, he hurriedly assembled a great 
force and marched on to Kundinapura. 
Leaving 
her 
apartments, 
Rukmini, 
accompanied by her retinue, went in 
procession to the temple, where divine 
service was held. 
"Oh Devi," implored Rukmini, praying for 
her intercession. "I prostrate myself before 
thee who knowest my devotion. Grant that 
Krishna may espouse me." 
Stepping out of the temple, Rukmini 
sighted Krishna's chariot and ran straight 
as a needle to the attracting magnet. She 
fled to him and got into his chariot. And 
Krishna drove off with her, to the 
bewilderment of all around.  
The servants ran to Rukma, the heir 
apparent, and related what had happened. 
"I 
will 
not 
return 
without 
killing 
Janardana," swore Rukma, and went in 
pursuit of Krishna with a large force.  
But, meanwhile, Balarama had arrived 
with his army, and a great battle ensued 
between the two opposing forces in which 
the enemy was utterly routed. Balarama 
and Krishna returned home in triumph, 
where Rukmini's wedding with Krishna 
was celebrated with customary rites.  
The defeated Rukma was ashamed to 
return to Kundinapura and built at the 
very site of the battle between Krishna 
and himself a new city, Bhojakata, over 
which he ruled.  
Hearing of the Kurukshetra battle, Rukma 
arrived there with a huge force. Thinking 
that he could thereby win the friendship of 
Vasudeva, 
he 
offered 
help 
to 
the 
Pandavas. 
"Oh 
Pandavas," 
said 
he 
addressing 
Dhananjaya, "the enemy forces are very 
large. I have come to help you. Give me 
the word and I shall attack whichever 
sector of the enemy formation you would 
like me to. I have the strength to attack 
Drona, Kripa or even Bhishma. I shall 
bring you victory. Only let me know your 
wish." 
Turning 
to 
Vasudeva, 
Dhananjaya 
laughed.  
"Oh, ruler of Bhojakata," said Arjuna, "we 
are not afraid of the size of the enemy 
forces. We have no need of your help and 
do not particularly desire it. You may 
either go away or stay on, just as you 
like."  
At this, Rukma was filled with anger and 
shame and went to Duryodhana's camp 
with 
his 
army. 
"The 
Pandavas 
have 
refused my proffered assistance." Said he 
to Duryodhana. "My forces are at your 
disposal."  
"Is it not after the Pandavas rejected your 
assistance that you have come here?" 
exclaimed Duryodhana, and added: "I am 
not in such dire need yet as to welcome 
their leavings."  
Rukma, thus put to disgrace by both sides, 
returned to his kingdom without taking 
part in battle. Neutrality in war may be of 
several kinds.  
It may arise from conscientious objection 
to war or it may be due to mere conceit 
and self-interest. Yet others may keep 
aloof through cowardice or sheer inertia.  
Balarama was neutral in the Mahabharata 
war because of his love of peace. Rukma, 
on the other hand, abstained as a result of 
his conceit.  
Instead of acting according to dharma, he 
thought of personal glory, and neither side 
would have him. 
61. NON-COOPERATION 
IT was the day before the commencement 
of the great battle. The grandsire, now the 
Kaurava 
Generalissimo, 
was 
with 
Duryodhana seeking to inspire him with 
his own heroic spirit and cheerfulness.  
Bhishma spoke of the strength, skill and 
prowess of the warriors ranged on the 
Kauravas' side. Duryodhana was cheered 
up. Presently, Karna became the subject 
of their talk. 
"Karna has earned your affection," said 
Bhishma, "but I do not think much of him. 
I do not like his great hatred of the 
Pandavas, and he is too boastful. There is 
no limit to his arrogance and he is much 
given to disparaging others. I would not 
place him in the highest rank among the 
warriors of the land. Besides, he has given 
away the divine armor with which he was 
born. He is not therefore likely to be of 
great help to me in this battle. The curse 
of 
Parasurama 
is 
on 
him 
too. 
His 
command of supernatural weapons will 
fail him in his hour of need, for he will not 
be able to remember the mantras. And the 
battle that will ensue between him and 
Arjuna will prove fatal for Karna."  
Thus 
spoke 
Bhishma 
without 
mincing 
matters, 
and 
this 
was 
exceedingly 
unpalatable to Duryodhana and Karna. To 
make matters worse, Drona agreed with 
the grandsire and said: 
"Karna 
is 
full 
of 
pride 
and 
overconfidence, which will cause him to 
be neglectful of the finer points of 
strategy, and through carelessness, he will 
suffer defeat." 
Enraged by these harsh words, Karna 
turned to the grandsire with flaming eyes. 
"You sir," said he, "have always slighted 
me through mere dislike and envy and 
have never neglected an opportunity of 
humiliating me, though I gave you no 
reason. I bore all your taunts and thrusts 
for the sake of Duryodhana. You have 
said that I would not be of much help in 
the impending war. Let me tell you my 
settled conviction, it is you, not I, who 
will fail the Kauravas. Why hide your real 
feelings? The fact of the matter is that you 
have 
no 
genuine 
affection 
for 
Duryodhana, but he does not know it. 
Hating me you seek to come between me 
and Duryodhana and poison his mind 
against me. And in furtherance of your 
wicked design, you have been belittling 
my strength and running me down. You 
have stooped to behavior unworthy of a 
kshatriya. Age alone does not confer a 
title to honor and respect among warriors, 
but prowess does. Desist from poisoning 
our relations."  
Turning then to Duryodhana, Karna said: 
"Illustrious warrior, think well and look to 
your own good. Do not place too great a 
reliance on the grandsire. He is trying to 
sow 
dissension 
in 
our 
ranks. 
His 
appraisement of me will injure your cause. 
By running me down, he seeks to dampen 
my enthusiasm. He has become senile and 
his time is up. His arrogance does not let 
him have regard for anyone else. Age 
must be respected and experience is useful 
but, as the sastras warn us, there is a point 
when age becomes senility and ripeness 
falls into rottenness and decay. You have 
made Bhishma your Generalissimo who 
will, I have no doubt, earn some fame 
from the heroic deeds of others. But I will 
not bear arms while he is in command. 
Only after he has fallen will I do so." 
The arrogant man is never conscious of 
his own arrogance. When accused of it, he 
charges the accuser with that very fault. 
His judgment is warped and he considers 
it a crime on the part of anyone to point 
out his defect. This is well illustrated in 
this episode. 
Controlling his anger, Bhishma replied: 
"Son of Surya, we are in a crisis and that 
is why you have not ceased to live this 
moment. You have been the evil genius of 
the 
Kauravas." 
Duryodhana 
was 
in 
distress. 
"Son of Ganga, I need the help of you 
both," he said. "You will both do deeds of 
great heroism, I have no doubt. At the 
break of dawn, the battle joins. Let there 
be no fighting among friends, with the foe 
in full force before us!" 
But Karna was adamant in that he would 
not take up arms so long as Bhishma was 
in 
supreme 
command. 
Duryodhana 
eventually yielded to Karna and suffered 
him to carry out his threat. 
Karna kept out during the first ten days of 
the battle, though all his men participated 
in it. At the end of the tenth day, when the 
great 
Bhishma 
lay 
on 
the 
battlefield 
covered all over with arrows, Karna went 
to him and bowed reverently and asked 
for forgiveness and blessings, which he 
received. 
Thereafter, Karna cooperated and himself 
proposed Drona for the command of the 
Kaurava forces in succession to Bhishma. 
When Drona also fell, Karna took over the 
command and led the Kaurava forces. 
62. KRISHNA TEACHES 
ALL was ready for the battle. The 
warriors on both sides gathered together 
and solemnly bound themselves to honor 
the traditional rules of war.  
The code of conduct in war and methods 
of warfare vary from time to time. It is 
only if what was in vogue at the time of 
the Mahabharata war is kept in mind that 
we can understand the epic. Otherwise, 
the story would be puzzling in places. 
From what follows, the reader may have 
some idea of the rules of warfare followed 
in the Kurukshetra battle. Each day, the 
battle was over at sunset, and the hostiles 
mixed freely like friends.  
Single combats might only be between 
equals and one could not use methods not 
in accordance with dharma. Thus those 
who left the field or retired would not be 
attacked. A horseman could attack only a 
horseman, not one on foot.  
Likewise, charioteers, elephant troops and 
infantrymen could engage themselves in 
battle only with their opposite numbers in 
the enemy ranks.  
Those who sought quarter or surrendered 
were safe from slaughter. Nor might one, 
for the moment disengaged, direct his 
weapons 
against 
another 
who 
was 
engaged in combat. 
It was wrong to slay one who had been 
disarmed or whose attention was directed 
elsewhere or who was retreating or who 
had lost his armor. And no shafts were to 
be 
directed 
against 
non-combatant 
attendants or those engaged in blowing 
conchs or beating drums.  
These were the rules that the Kauravas 
and the Pandavas solemnly declared they 
would follow. 
The passage of time has witnessed many 
changes in men's ideas of right and wrong. 
Nothing is exempt from attack in modern 
warfare.  
Not only are munitions made the target of 
attack, but dumb animals such as horses, 
camels, mules and medical stores, nay, 
non-combatants of all ages, are destroyed 
without compunction. 
Sometimes 
the 
established 
conventions 
went overboard even in the Mahabharata 
war.  
We see clearly in the story that occasional 
transgressions took place for one reason 
or another. But, on the whole, the 
accepted rules of honorable and humane 
war were observed by both sides in the 
Kurukshetra battle. And the occasional 
violations were looked upon as wrong and 
shameful. 
Addressing 
the 
princes 
under 
his 
command, Bhishma said: "Heroes, yours 
is a glorious opportunity. Before you, are 
the gates of heaven wide open. The joy of 
living with Indra and Brahma awaits you. 
Pursue the path of your ancestors and 
follow the kshatriya dharma. Fight with 
joy and attain fame and greatness. A 
kshatriya does not wish to die of disease 
or old age in his bed but prefers to die on 
the battlefield," and the princes responded 
by ordering their trumpets to be sounded 
and shouted victory to the Kauravas.  
On Bhishma's flag shone brightly the 
palm tree and five stars. On Aswatthama's 
the lion tail fluttered in the air.  
In 
Drona's 
golden-hued standard, the 
ascetic's bowl and the bow glistened, and 
the cobra of Duryodhana's famed banner 
danced proudly with outspread hood.  
On Kripa's flag was depicted a bull, while 
Jayadratha's carried a wild boar. Likewise 
others and the battlefield thus presented a 
pageant of flags.  
Seeing the Kaurava forces ranged in battle 
array, Yudhishthira gave orders to Arjuna: 
"The enemy force is very large. Our army 
being smaller, our tactics should 
be 
concentration rather than deployment that 
will only weaken us. Array our forces,  
therefore, in needle formation." 
Now, when Arjuna saw men arrayed on 
both sides for mutual slaughter, he was 
deeply agitated and Krishna spoke to him 
in order to quell his agitation and remove 
his doubts. 
Krishna's exhortation to Arjuna at this 
juncture is the Bhagavad Gita, which is 
enshrined in millions of hearts as the 
Word of God. The Bhagavad Gita is 
acknowledged by all as one of the 
supreme treasures of human literature.  
Its gospel of devotion to duty, without 
attachment or desire of reward, has shown 
the way of life for all men, rich or poor, 
learned or ignorant, who have sought for 
light in the dark problems of life. 
63. YUDHISHTHIRA SEEKS 
BENEDICTION 
EVERYTHING was ready for the battle 
to begin. At this tense moment, both 
armies saw with amazement Yudhishthira, 
the steadfast and brave son of Pandu, 
suddenly doff his armor and put away his 
weapons. Descending from his chariot, he 
proceeded on foot towards the commander 
of the Kaurava forces.  
"What is this that Yudhishthira is doing?" 
asked everyone and was puzzled by this 
sudden and silent proceeding on the part 
of the Pandava. 
Dhananjaya too was perplexed and he 
jumped down from his chariot and ran to 
Yudhishthira. 
The 
other 
brothers 
and 
Krishna also joined.  
They feared that perhaps Yudhishthira, 
surrendering to his natural inclination, had 
suddenly decided to seek peace on any 
terms and was going forward to announce 
this. 
"King, why are you proceeding to the 
enemy's lines in this strange manner? You 
have told us nothing. The enemy is ready 
for battle, their soldiers sheathed in armor 
and with uplifted weapons. But you have 
doffed your armor and thrown aside your 
weapons and are proceeding forward, 
unattended and on foot. Tell us what you 
are 
about." 
Thus 
said 
Arjuna 
to 
Dharmaputra. 
But 
Yudhishthira 
was 
immersed in deep thought and proceeded 
forward silently.  
Then Vasudeva, who knew the hearts of 
men, smiled and said: "He is going to the 
elders to ask for their benediction before 
commencing this terrible fight. He feels it 
is not right to start such a grave 
proceeding without formally taking such 
benediction and permission. He goes to 
the grandsire to take his blessing and that 
of Dronacharya. So he goes unarmed. It is 
right 
that 
he 
does 
this. 
He 
knows 
proprieties. It is only thus that we might 
fare well in this battle." 
The men in Duryodhana's army, when 
they saw Yudhishthira advancing with 
hands clasped in humble attitude, thought: 
"Here is the Pandava coming to sue for 
peace, frightened at our strength. Truly 
this man brings disgrace to the race of 
kshatriyas. Why was this coward born 
among us?" Thus did they talk among 
themselves reviling Dharmaputra though 
delighted at the prospect of securing 
victory without a blow. 
Yudhishthira went through the lines of 
soldiers armed from head to foot and 
proceeded straight to where Bhishma was 
and, bending low and touching his feet in 
salutation, said:  
"Grandsire, permit us to begin the battle. 
We have dared to give battle to you, our 
unconquerable 
and 
incomparable 
grandsire. We seek benediction before 
beginning the fight." 
"Child," replied the grandsire, "born in the 
race of Bharatas, you have acted worthily 
and according to our code of conduct. It 
gives me joy to see this. Fight and you 
will have victory. I am not a free agent. I 
am bound by my obligation to the king 
and must fight on the side of the 
Kauravas. But you will not be defeated." 
After thus obtaining the permission and 
the 
blessings 
of 
the 
grandsire, 
Yudhishthira 
went 
to 
Drona 
and 
circumambulated and bowed, according to 
form, to the acharya, who also gave his 
blessings, saying: 
"I am under inescapable obligations to the 
Kauravas, O son of Dharma. Our vested 
interests enslave us and become our 
masters. Thus have I become bound to the 
Kauravas. I shall fight on their side. But 
yours will be the victory." 
Yudhishthira 
similarly 
approached 
and 
obtained the blessings of Kripacharya and 
uncle Salya and returned to the Pandava 
lines. 
The battle began, commencing with single 
combats between the leading chiefs armed 
with equal weapons. Bhishma and Partha, 
Satyaki and Kritavarma, Abhimanyu and 
Brihatbala, 
Duryodhana 
and 
Bhima, 
Yudhishthira 
and 
Salya, 
and 
Dbrishtadyumna and Drona were thus 
engaged in great battles.  
Similarly, thousands of other warriors 
fought severally according to the rules of 
war of those days.  
Besides these numerous single combats 
between renowned warriors, there was 
also 
indiscriminate 
fighting 
among 
common soldiers. The name of "sankula 
yuddha" was given to such free fighting 
and 
promiscuous 
carnage. 
The 
Kurukshetra battle witnessed many such 
"sankula" fights wherein countless men 
fought and died in the mad lust of battle. 
On the field lay piles of slaughtered 
soldiers, charioteers, elephants and horses. 
The ground became a bloody mire in 
which it was difficult for the chariots to 
move about. In modern battles there is no 
such thing as single combats. It is all 
"sankula." 
The Kauravas fought under Bhishma's 
command for ten days. After him, Drona 
took the command. When Drona died, 
Karna succeeded to the command. Karna 
fell towards the close of the seventeenth 
day's battle. And Salya led the Kaurava 
army on the eighteenth and last day. 
Towards the latter part of the battle, many 
savage and unchivalrous deeds were done. 
Chivalry and rules of war die hard, for 
there is an innate nobility in human 
nature. 
But 
difficult 
situations 
and 
temptations arise which men are too weak 
to 
resist, 
especially 
when 
they 
are 
exhausted with fighting and warped with 
hatred and bloodshed.  
Even great men commit wrong and their 
lapses thereafter furnish bad examples to 
others, 
and 
dharma 
comes 
to 
be 
disregarded more and more easily and 
frequently. Thus does violence beget and 
nourish adharma and plunge the world in 
wickedness. 
64. THE FIRST DAY'S BATTLE 
DUHSASANA was leading the Kaurava 
forces and Bhimasena did the same on the 
Pandava side. The noise of battle rolled 
and 
rent 
the 
air. 
The 
kettledrums, 
trumpets, horns and conchs made the sky 
ring with their clamor. 
Horses 
neighed, 
charging 
elephants 
trumpeted and the warriors uttered their 
lion-roars. Arrows flew in the air like 
burning meteors. Fathers and sons, uncles 
and nephews slew one another forgetful of 
old affection and ties of blood. It was a 
mad and terrible carnage. In the forenoon 
of the first day's battle the Pandava army 
was badly shaken. Wherever Bhishma's 
chariot went, it was like the dance of the 
destroyer. Abhimanyu could not bear this 
and he attacked the grandsire. When the 
oldest and the youngest warriors thus met 
in battle, the gods came to watch the 
combat. Abhimanyu's flag, displaying the 
golden karnikara tree brightly waved on 
his chariot.  
Kritavarma was hit by one of his arrows 
and Salya was hit five times. Bhishma 
himself 
was 
hit 
nine 
times 
by 
Abhimanyu's 
shafts. 
Durmukha's 
charioteer 
was 
struck 
by 
one 
of 
Abhimanyu's sword-edge arrow and his 
severed head rolled on the ground.  
Another broke Kripa's bow. Abhimanyu's 
feats brought down showers of flowers 
from the gods who looked on. Bhishma 
and the warrior supporting him exclaimed: 
"Indeed, a worthy son to Dhananjaya!" 
Then the Kaurava warriors made 
a 
combined attack on the valiant youth. But 
he stood against them all. He parried with 
his own all the shafts discharged by 
Bhishma.  
One of his well-aimed arrows brought the 
grandsire's palm tree flag down. Seeing 
this, Bhimasena was overjoyed and made 
a great lion-roar that further inspired the 
valiant nephew. Great was the grandsire's 
joy, seeing the valor of the young hero. 
Unwillingly, 
he 
had 
to 
use 
his 
full 
strength against the boy. Virata, his son 
Uttara, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
the 
son 
of 
Drupada and Bhima came to relieve the 
young hero and attacked the grandsire 
who then turned his attentions on them.  
Uttara, the son of Virata, rode an elephant 
and led a fierce charge on Salya. Salya's 
chariot horses were trampled to death and 
thereupon he hurled a javelin at Uttara. It 
went with unerring aim and pierced him in 
the chest.  
The goad he had in his hand dropped and 
he rolled down dead. But the elephant did 
not withdraw. It continued charging until 
Salya cut off its trunk and hit it in many 
places with his arrows. And then it uttered 
a loud cry and fell dead. Salya got into 
Kritavarma's car. 
Virata's son Sveta saw Salya slay his 
younger brother. His anger rose, like fire 
fed by libations of butter. And he drove 
his chariot towards Salya. Seven chariot 
warriors at once came up in support of 
Salya and protected him from all sides.  
Arrows were showered on Sveta and the 
missiles sped across like lightning in 
clouds. 
Sveta 
defended 
himself 
marvelously. He parried their shafts with 
his own and cut their javelins down as 
they sped towards him. The warriors in 
both armies were amazed at the skill 
displayed by Sveta. Duryodhana lost no 
time now and sent forces to relieve Salya. 
Whereupon there was a great battle. 
Thousands 
of 
soldiers 
perished, 
and 
numerous were the chariots broken and 
the horses and elephants killed. Sveta 
succeeded in putting Duryodhana's men to 
flight and he pushed forward and attacked 
Bhishma.  
Bhishma's flag was brought down by 
Sveta. Bhishma, in his turn, killed Sveta's 
horses and charioteer. There upon, they 
hurled javelins at one another and fought 
on.  
Sveta took a mace, and swinging it, sent it 
at Bhishma's car which was smashed to 
pieces. But the grandsire, even before the 
mace dashed against the chariot, had 
anticipated it and jumped down. From the 
ground he pulled the string of his bow to 
his ear and sent a fatal arrow at Sveta. 
Sveta was struck and fell dead. Duhsasana 
blew his horn and danced in joy. This was 
followed by a great attack on the Pandava 
army by Bhishma. 
The Pandava forces suffered greatly on 
the first day of the battle. Dharmaputra 
was 
seized 
with 
apprehension, 
and 
Duryodhana's joy was unbounded. The 
brothers came to Krishna and were 
engaged in anxious consultations. 
"Chief among Bharatas," said Krishna to 
Yudhishthira, "do not fear. God has 
blessed you with valiant brothers. Why 
should you entertain any doubts? There is 
Satyaki and there are Virata, Drupada and 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
besides 
myself. 
What 
reason is there for you to be dejected? Do 
you forget that Sikhandin is awaiting for 
his predestined victim Bhishma?" Thus 
did Krishna comfort Yudhishthira.  
65. THE SECOND DAY 
THE Pandava army, having fared badly 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
the 
battle, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
the 
Generalissimo, 
devised measures to avoid a repetition of 
it. On the second day, the army was most 
carefully arrayed and everything was done 
to instil confidence.  
Duryodhana, 
filled 
with 
conceit 
on 
account of the success on the first day, 
stood in the center of his army and 
addressed his warriors. 
"Heroes in armor", he said in a loud voice, 
"our victory is assured. Fight and care not 
for life." 
The Kaurava army, led by Bhishma, again 
made strong attack on the Pandava forces 
and broke their formation, killing large 
numbers. 
Arjuna, turning to Krishna, his charioteer, 
said: "If we continue in this way, our army 
will soon be totally destroyed by the 
grandsire. Unless we slay Bhishma, I am 
afraid we can not save our army." 
"Dhananjaya, then get ready. There is the 
grandsire's chariot," replied Krishna, and 
drove straight towards him. 
The chariot sped forward at a great pace. 
The grandsire sent his shafts welcoming 
the challenge. Duryodhana had ordered 
his men to protect the grandsire most 
vigilantly and never to let him expose 
himself to danger.  
Accordingly, all the warriors, supporting 
the grandsire, at once intervened and 
attacked Arjuna who, however, fought on 
unconcerned.  
It was well known that there were but 
three on the Kaurava side who could stand 
against Arjuna with any chance of success 
the grandsire Bhishma, Drona and Karna. 
Arjuna made short work of the warriors, 
who intervened in support of Bhishma.  
The way in which he wielded his great 
bow 
on 
this 
occasion, 
extorted 
the 
admiration of all the great generals in the 
army. His chariot flashed hither and 
thither sundering hostile ranks like forked 
lightning, so rapidly that the eye ached to 
follow its career. 
Duryodhana's 
heart 
beat 
fast 
as 
he 
watched this combat. His confidence in 
the great Bhishma began to be shaken. 
"Son of Ganga," Duryodhana said, "it 
seems as if even while you and Drona are 
alive 
and 
fighting, 
this 
irresistible 
combination of Arjuna and Krishna will 
destroy our entire army. Karna whose 
devotion and loyalty to me are most 
genuine stands aside and does not fight for 
me only because of you. I fear I shall be 
deceived and you will not take steps 
quickly to destroy Phalguna (Arjuna)." 
The gods came down to watch the combat 
between Bhishma and Arjuna. These were 
two of the greatest warriors on earth. Both 
chariots were drawn by white steeds.  
From either side flew arrows in countless 
number. Shaft met shaft in the air and 
sometimes 
the 
grandsire's 
missile 
hit 
Arjuna's breast and that of Madhava 
(Krishna). And the blood flowing made 
Madhava more beautiful than ever as he 
stood like a green palasa tree in full bloom 
with crimson flowers. 
Arjuna's wrath rose when he saw his dear 
charioteer hit and he pulled his bow and 
sent well-aimed arrows at the grandsire. 
The combatants were equal and the battle 
raged for a long while.  
In the movements the chariots made they 
were so close to one another and moved 
about so fast that it was not possible to say 
where Arjuna was and where Bhishma. 
Only the flag could be distinguished.  
As this great and wonderful scene was 
enacted in one part of the field, at another 
place a fierce battle was being fought 
between Drona and his born enemy 
Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the king of 
the Panchalas and brother of Draupadi.  
Drona's 
attack 
was 
powerful 
and 
Dhrishtadyumna was wounded badly. But 
the latter retaliated with equal vigor and 
with a grin of hatred he shot arrows and 
sped other missiles at Drona.  
Drona defended himself with great skill. 
He parried the sharp missiles and the 
heavy maces hurled at him with his 
arrows and broke them to pieces even as 
they sped in the air.  
Many times did Dhrishtadyumna's bow 
break, hit by Drona's arrows. One of 
Drona's 
arrows 
killed 
the 
Panchala 
prince's 
charioteer. 
Thereupon 
Dhrishtadyumna took up a mace and, 
jumping down from the chariot, went 
forward on foot.  
Drona sent an arrow that brought the mace 
down. 
Dhrishtadyumna 
then 
drew his 
sword and rushed forward like a lion 
springing on its elephant prey. But Drona 
again disabled him and prevented his 
advance.  
Just then Bhima, who saw the Panchala's 
predicament, sent a shower of arrows on 
Drona and carried Dhrishtadyumna to 
safety in his chariot. 
Duryodhana 
who 
saw 
this 
sent 
the 
Kalinga forces against Bhimasena. Bhima 
killed 
the 
Kalinga 
warriors 
in 
great 
number. Like Death itself he moved about 
among his enemies and felled them to the 
ground. So fierce was the destruction that 
the entire army trembled in fear.  
When Bhishma saw this, he came to 
relieve the Kalingas. Satyaki, Abhimanyu 
and other warriors came up in support of 
Bhima. One of Satyaki's shafts brought 
Bhishma's charioteer down and the horses 
of Bhishma's chariot, left uncontrolled, 
bolted carrying Bhishma away from the 
field.  
The 
Pandava 
army 
was 
wild 
with 
enthusiasm when Bhishma's chariot sped 
thus out of the field. They took advantage 
of the situation and made a fierce attack 
on the Kaurava army.  
Great was the loss the Kaurava army 
suffered in that day's battle as a result of 
Arjuna's deeds of valor. The generals of 
the Kaurava army were greatly perturbed 
and their previous day's enthusiasm had 
all disappeared.  
They eagerly looked forward to sunset 
when there would be an end to the day's 
battle. As the sun sank in the west, 
Bhishma said to Drona: "It is well we stop 
the 
fighting 
now. 
Our 
army 
is 
disheartened and weary." 
On the side of the Pandavas, Dhananjaya 
and others returned in great cheer to their 
camp, with bands playing. At the end of 
the second day's battle, the Kauravas were 
in the mood that the Pandavas were in the 
previous evening.  
66. THE THIRD DAY'S BATTLE 
ON the morning of the third day Bhishma 
arrayed his army in eagle formation and 
himself led it while Duryodhana and his 
forces protected the rear. So great was the 
care taken over every detail that the 
Kauravas were certain that there could be 
no mishap for them that day.  
The Pandavas too arrayed their forces 
with 
skill. 
Dhananjaya 
and 
Dhrishtadyumna decided in favor of a 
crescent formation of their army so as 
more effectually to cope with the eagle 
formation of the enemy's forces.  
On the right horn of the crescent stood 
Bhima and on the left Arjuna, leading the 
respective divisions. The battle began. All 
arms were at once engaged and blood 
flowed in torrents and the dust that was 
raised by chariots, horses and elephants 
rose to hide the sun.  
Dhananjaya's attack was powerful but the 
enemy stood firm. A counter-attack was 
made by the Kauravas concentrating on 
Arjuna's position. Javelins and spears and 
other missiles flew in the air shining like 
forked lightning in a thunderstorm.  
Like a great cloud of locusts the shafts 
covered 
Arjuna's 
chariot. 
But 
with 
amazing 
skill 
he 
raised 
a 
moving 
fortification 
around 
his 
chariot 
with 
arrows discharged in an unending stream 
from his famous bow.  
At another point Sakuni led a large force 
against Satyaki and Abhimanyu. Satyaki's 
chariot was broken to pieces and he had to 
scramble up Abhimanyu's chariot and 
thereafter both fought from the same 
chariot.  
They were able to destroy Sakuni's forces. 
Drona 
and 
Bhishma 
jointly 
attacked 
Dharmaputra's division and Nakula and 
Sahadeva joined their brother in opposing 
Drona's offensive.  
Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked 
Duryodhana's division and in that day's 
battle the son appeared to excel his great 
father in valor.  
Bhima's shafts hit Duryodhana and he lay 
in swoon in his chariot. His charioteer 
quickly drove the chariot away from the 
scene. He feared that the Kaurava forces 
would be completely demoralised if they 
saw that the prince had been disabled.  
But even this movement created great 
confusion. Bhimasena took full advantage 
of the position and worked havoc among 
the fleeing Kaurava forces. 
Drona 
and 
Bhishma 
who 
saw 
the 
discomfiture 
and 
confusion 
of 
the 
Kaurava army came up quickly and 
restored confidence. The scattered forces 
were brought together and Duryodhana 
was again seen leading them. 
"How 
can 
you 
stand 
thus," 
said 
Duryodhana to the grandsire, "looking on 
when our forces are scattered and put to 
disgraceful flight? I fear you are too kind 
to the Pandavas. Why did you not tell me 
frankly 
'I 
love 
the 
Pandavas; 
Dhrishtadyumna 
and 
Satyaki 
are 
my 
friends and I cannot attack or slay them.' 
You should have stated the position 
explicitly to me. Surely these men are not 
equal to you. And if you were so minded, 
you could deal with them easily. Even 
now, it would be best if you and Drona 
told me frankly your mind in the matter." 
The chagrin of defeat, and the knowledge 
that the grandsire disapproved of his ways 
made Duryodhana speak thus bitterly. But 
Bhishma merely smiled and said: "Wasn't 
I quite frank in my advice to you? That 
advice you rejected when you decided on 
war. I tried to prevent the war but, now 
that it has come, I am fulfilling my duties 
by you with all my might. I am an old 
man and what I am doing is quite my 
utmost." 
Saying thus, the grandsire resumed his 
operations. The turn of events in the 
forenoon had been so much in their favor 
that the delighted Pandavas were now 
somewhat careless.  
They did not expect Bhishma to rally his 
forces and attack them again. But stung by 
Duryodhana's reproaches, the grandsire 
raged about the field like a destroying fire.  
He rallied his men and delivered the most 
severe attack yet made on the Pandava 
army. The latter thought that the grandsire 
had multiplied himself into a number of 
Bhishmas fighting at several points. So 
swift were his movements that afternoon.  
Those who opposed him were struck 
down and perished like months in the fire. 
The Pandava army was thoroughly broken 
and began to scatter. Vasudeva, Partha 
and Sikhandin tried hard to restore order 
and confidence, but were unsuccessful.  
"Dhanjaya," said Krishna, "now has the 
critical time come. Be true to your 
decision not to flinch from your duty to 
kill in battle Bhishma, Drona and all the 
other friends and relatives and respected 
elders. You have pledged yourself to it 
and you have now to carry it out. 
Otherwise 
our 
army 
is 
lost 
beyond 
redemption. You must now attack the 
grandsire." 
"Drive on," said Arjuna.  
As Dhananjaya's chariot sped on towards 
Bhishma, it met a hot reception from the 
grandsire, who covered it with his arrows.  
But, Arjuna bent his bow and discharged 
three shafts that broke the grandsire's bow. 
Bhishma picked up another bow but it too 
met the same fate. The grandsire's heart 
was gladdened when he saw Arjuna's skill 
in archery. 
"Hail, 
brave 
warrior!" 
applauded 
the 
grandsire, even as, taking up another bow; 
he poured shafts on Arjuna's chariot with 
unerring aim. 
Krishna was not happy at the way Arjuna 
met the attack. The grandsire's bow was 
working fiercely. But Arjuna's hands did 
not do their best, for his heart was not in 
it.  
He had too much regard for his great 
grandsire. Krishna thought that, if Arjuna 
went on like this, the army, which had 
been so badly demoralized already, would 
be utterly destroyed and all would be lost.  
Krishna managed the chariot skilfully, but 
in spite of it, both he and Arjuna were hit 
many times by Bhishma's arrows.  
Janardana's (Krishna) anger rose. "I can 
stand this no longer, Arjuna. I shall kill 
Bhishma myself if you will not do it!" he 
exclaimed, and dropping the reins, he took 
up his discus and jumped down from the 
chariot 
and 
dashed 
forward 
towards 
Bhishma. 
Bhishma was far from being perturbed at 
this. On the contrary, his face expanded 
with ecstatic joy. "Come, come, Oh Lotus-
eyed One!" he exclaimed.  
"I bow to you, Oh Madhava. Lord of the 
World, have you indeed come down from 
the chariot for my sake? I offer you my 
life. If I be slain by you, I shall be 
glorified in the three worlds. Give me that 
boon. May your hands take this life away 
and save me for eternity." 
Arjuna was distressed to see this. He 
jumped down and ran after Krishna. 
Overtaking him with great difficulty, he 
entreated Krishna to turn back. 
"Do not lose your patience with me. 
Desist and I promise not to flinch," he 
said, and persuaded Krishna to return. The 
chariot reins were again in Krishna's 
hands. Arjuna attacked the Kaurava forces 
furiously and thousands were slain by 
him. 
The Kauravas suffered a severe defeat on 
the evening of the third day. As they 
returned to their camps in torchlight, they 
said to one another: "Who can equal 
Arjuna? There is nothing strange in his 
being 
victorious." 
So 
marvelous 
was 
Arjuna's prowess that day. 
67. THE FOURTH DAY 
THE battle was very much the same every 
day 
and 
the 
narrative 
is 
one 
of 
monotonous fighting and killing. Still, the 
great battle is the central event in the 
Mahabharata and, if we skip over it, we 
cannot fully understand the epic heroes of 
that crowded stage.  
At break of day, Bhishma arrayed the 
Kaurava forces again. Surrounded by 
Drona, 
Duryodhana 
and 
others, 
the 
grandsire looked verily like great Indra, 
holding his thunder bolt, surrounded by 
the devas.  
The Kaurava army, with its chariots, 
elephants and horses all arrayed in battle 
order and ready for the fight, presented 
the appearance of the sky in a great 
thunderstorm. 
The grandsire gave orders for advance. 
Arjuna watched the hostile movements 
from his chariot, whereon the Hanuman 
flag was waving, and he too got ready.  
The 
battle 
commenced. 
Aswatthama, 
Bhurisravas, Salya, Chitrasena and the son 
of 
Chala 
surrounded 
Abhimanyu 
and 
attacked him. The warrior fought like a 
lion opposing five elephants.  
Arjuna saw this combined attack on his 
son and, with a wrathful lion roar joined 
his son whereat the tempo of fighting 
flared up. Dhrishtadyumna also arrived 
with a large force. The son of Chala was 
killed.  
Chala himself now joined and he with 
Salya, 
made 
a 
strong 
attack 
on 
Dhrishtadyumna. The latter's bow was 
severed into two by a sharp missile 
discharged by Salya. 
Abhimanyu saw this and sent a shower of 
arrows on Salya and put him in such 
danger that Duryodhana and his brothers 
rushed to Salya's help. Bhimasena also 
appeared on the scene at this juncture.  
When 
Bhima 
raised 
his 
mace 
aloft, 
Duryodhana's 
brothers 
lost 
courage. 
Duryodhana, 
who 
saw 
this, 
was 
exceedingly 
angry 
and 
immediately 
charged against Bhima with a large force 
of elephants.  
As soon as Bhima saw the elephants 
coming up, he descended from his chariot, 
iron mace in hand, attacked them so 
fiercely that they scattered in a wild 
stampede, throwing the Kaurava ranks 
into disorder.  
It will be seen that even in our Puranic 
stories elephants fared as badly in battle as 
they did in the wars of the Greeks and the 
Romans. Bhima's attack on the elephants 
was like Indra's devastating onslaught on 
the winged mountains.  
The slaughtered elephants lay dead on the 
field like great hills. Those that escaped 
fled in panic and caused great havoc in the 
Kaurava 
army, 
trampling 
numerous 
soldiers in their wild race. Duryodhana, 
thereupon, ordered a wholesale attack on 
Bhima.  
But he stood firm as a rock and presently, 
the Pandava warriors came up and joined 
him. A number of Duryodhana's arrows 
struck Bhima's chest and he climbed up 
his chariot again.  
"Visoka, now is the glad hour," said 
Bhima to his charioteer. "I see a number 
of Dhritarashtra's sons before me, ready to 
be shaken down like ripe fruits on a tree. 
Keep your hold well on the reins and 
drive on. I am going to dispatch these 
wretches 
to 
Yama's 
abode." 
Bhima's 
arrows would have killed Duryodhana 
then and there, had it not been for his 
armor.  
Eight of Duryodhana's brothers were slain 
in that day's battle by Bhima. Duryodhana 
fought 
fiercely. 
Bhima's 
bow 
was 
smashed by one of Duryodhana's arrows. 
Taking up a fresh bow, Bhima sent an 
arrow with a knife-edge at Duryodhana 
that cut the latter's bow into two.  
Not baffled by this, Duryodhana took up a 
fresh bow and discharged a well-aimed 
shaft which struck Bhima on his chest 
with such force that he reeled and sat 
down.  
The Pandava warriors now poured a great 
shower 
of 
arrows 
on 
Duryodhana. 
Ghatotkacha, who saw his father sit dazed 
with 
the 
force 
of 
the 
blow, 
got 
exceedingly angry and fell on the Kaurava 
army, which was unable to stand against 
his onslaught. 
"We cannot fight this Rakshasa today." 
said Bhishma to Drona. "Our men are 
weary. It is nearing sunset and at night of 
the Rakshasas grows stronger with the 
darkness. Let us deal with Ghatotkacha 
tomorrow." 
The grandsire ordered his army to retire 
for the night. Duryodhana sat musing in 
his tent, his eyes filled with tears. He had 
lost many of his brothers in that day's 
battle. 
"Sanjaya," 
exclaimed 
Dhritarashtra. 
"Every day, you give me nothing but bad 
news. Your tale has ever been one of 
sorrow, of defeat and loss of dear ones! I 
cannot 
stand 
this 
any 
more. 
What 
stratagem can save my people? How are 
we going to win in this fight? Indeed, I am 
full of fear. It seems fate is more powerful 
than human effort." 
"King " said Sanjaya in reply, "is this not 
all the result of your own folly? Of what 
avail is grief? How can I manufacture 
good news for you? You should hear the 
truth with fortitude." 
"Ah! Vidura's words are coming true," 
said the blind old king, plunged in great 
grief. 
68. THE FIFTH DAY 
"I AM like a shipwrecked man seeking to 
save himself by swimming in a storm 
tossed 
ocean. 
I 
shall 
surely 
drown, 
overwhelmed in this sea of sorrow." 
Again and again, when Sanjaya related the 
happenings 
of 
the 
great 
battle, 
Dhritarashtra would thus lament, unable 
to bear his grief. 
"Bhima is going to kill all my sons," he 
said. "I do not believe there is anyone with 
prowess enough in our army to protect my 
sons from death. Did Bhishma, Drona, 
Kripa 
and 
Aswatthama 
look 
on 
unconcerned when our army fled in 
terror? What indeed is their plan? When 
and 
how 
are 
they 
going 
to 
help 
Duryodhana? How are my sons to escape 
from destruction?" 
Saying thus, the blind old king burst into 
tears.  
"Calm yourself, King," said Sanjaya. "The 
Pandavas rest on the strength of a just 
cause. So, they win. Your sons are brave 
but their thoughts are wicked. Therefore, 
luck does not favor them. They have done 
great injustice to the Pandavas, and they 
are reaping the harvest of their sins. The 
Pandavas are not winning by charms or 
magic 
incantations. 
They 
are 
fighting 
according to the practice of kshatriyas. 
Their cause being just, they have strength. 
Friends advised you, but you discarded 
wise counsel. Vidura, Bhishma, Drona 
and I tried to stop you in your unwise 
course, but you did not listen and you 
went on. Like a foolish sick man who 
refuses to drink bitter medicine, you 
obstinately refused to follow our advice, 
which would have saved your people, 
preferring to do as your foolish son 
desired. You are in distress now. Last 
night, Duryodhana asked Bhishma the 
same question as you put to me now. And 
Bhishma gave the same answer as I give 
you." 
When the fighting was stopped on the 
evening of the fourth day, Duryodhana 
went by himself to Bhishma's tent and, 
bowing reverently, said: 
"Grandsire, the world knows that you are 
a warrior who knows not fear. The same is 
the case with Drona, Kripa, Aswatthama, 
Kritavarma, 
Sudakshin, 
Bhurisravas, 
Vikarna and Bhagadatta. Death has no 
terror for these veterans. There is no 
doubt, the prowess of these great warriors 
is limitless, even like your own. All the 
Pandavas combined cannot defeat any one 
of you. What then is the mystery behind 
this daily defeat of our army at the hands 
of the sons of Kunti?" 
Bhishma replied: "Prince, listen to me. I 
have given you advice on every occasion 
and told you what was good for you. But, 
you have always refused to follow what 
your elders counselled you to do. Again, I 
tell you that it is best for you to make 
peace with Pandu's sons. For your good as 
well as for that of the world, that is the 
only course that should be followed. 
Belonging to the same royal house, you 
can all enjoy this vast country as yours. I 
gave you this advice, but you disregarded 
it 
and 
have 
grievously 
wronged 
the 
Pandavas, the fruit of which you are now 
reaping. The Pandavas are protected by 
Krishna himself. How then can you hope 
for victory? Even now, it is not loo late 
for making peace and that is the way to 
rule your kingdom, making the Pandavas, 
your powerful brothers, friends instead of 
enemies. Destruction awaits you if you 
insult Dhananjaya and Krishna, who are 
none other than Nara and Narayana." 
Duryodhana took leave and went to his 
tent, but he could not sleep that night. 
The battle was resumed the next morning. 
Bhishma arrayed the Kaurava forces in a 
strong formation. So did Dhrishtadyumna 
for the Pandava army.  
Bhima stood at the head of the advance 
lines 
as 
usual. 
And 
Sikhandin, 
Dhrishtadyumna 
and 
Satyaki 
stood 
behind, securely guarding the main body, 
aided by other generals.  
Dharmaputra and the twin brothers held 
the rear. Bhishma bent his bow and 
discharged his shafts. The Pandava army 
suffered 
greatly 
under 
the 
grandsire's 
attack. 
Dhananjaya saw this and retaliated by 
fierce 
shafts 
aimed 
at 
Bhishma. 
Duryodhana 
went 
to 
Drona 
and 
complained 
bitterly 
according 
to 
his 
custom.  
Drona upbraided him severely: "Obstinate 
prince, you talk without understanding. 
You 
are 
ignorant 
of 
the 
Pandavas' 
strength. We are doing our best."  
Drona's powerful attack on the Pandava 
army was too much for Satyaki who was 
meeting it and Bhima therefore turned his 
attentions to Drona. The battle grew 
fiercer still. Drona, Bhishma and Salya 
made a combined attack on Bhima.  
Sikhandin supported Bhima by pouring a 
shower of arrows on Bhishma. As soon as 
Sikhandin stepped in, Bhishma turned 
away. For Sikhandin was born a girl, and 
Bhishma's principles did not permit him to 
attack a woman.  
In the end, this same objection proved to 
be the cause of Bhishma's death. When 
Drona 
saw 
Bhishma 
turn 
away, 
he 
attacked Sikhandin fiercely and compelled 
him to withdraw. 
There was a promiscuous battle the whole 
of the morning of the fifth day, and the 
slaughter was terrific. In the after noon, 
Duryodhana sent a large force to oppose 
Satyaki.  
But Satyaki destroyed it completely and 
advanced 
to 
attack 
Bhurisravas. 
Bhurisravas, 
who 
was 
a 
powerful 
opponent, put Satyaki's men to fight, and 
pressed Satyaki himself so fiercely that he 
was in distress.  
Satyaki's ten sons saw their father's plight 
and sought to relieve him by launching an 
offensive 
against 
Bhurisravas, 
but 
Bhurisravas 
undaunted 
by 
numbers, 
opposed the combined attack and was not 
to be shaken. His well-aimed darts broke 
their weapons and they were all slain, 
strewn on the field like so many tall trees 
struck down by lightning. Satyaki, wild 
with rage and grief, drove forward at a 
furious pace to slay Bhurisravas.  
The chariots of the two warriors dashed 
against each other and crumbled to pieces. 
And the warriors stood face to face with 
sword and shield in desperate single 
combat. 
Then, Bhima came and took away Satyaki 
by force into his chariot and drove away. 
For Bhima knew that Bhurisravas was an 
unrivalled swordsman and he did not want 
Satyaki to be slain. 
Arjuna killed thousands of warriors that 
evening. The soldiers, dispatched against 
him by Duryodhana, perished like moths 
in the fire. As the sun went down and 
Bhishma gave orders to cease fighting, the 
princes on the Pandava army surrounded 
Arjuna and greeted him with loud cries of 
admiration and victory. 
The armies on both sides retired to camp, 
along with the tired horses and elephants.  
69. THE SIXTH DAY 
ACCORDING 
to 
Yudhishthira's 
order 
Dhrishtadyumna 
arrayed 
the 
Pandava 
army in makara (fish) formation for the 
sixth day's battle. The Kaurava army was 
arrayed in krauncha (heron) formation.  
We know, how, similarly, names were 
given to physical exercise, asanas, or 
postures. Vyuha was the general name for 
battle array. Which Vyuha was best for 
any particular occasion, depended on the 
requirements 
of 
the 
offensive 
and 
defensive plans of the day.  
What the strength and composition of the 
forces 
arrayed 
should 
be 
and 
what 
positions 
they 
should 
take 
up 
were 
decided upon, according to the situation as 
it developed from time to time.  
The sixth day was marked by a prodigious 
slaughter, even in the first part of the 
morning. Drona's charioteer was killed 
and Drona took the reins of the horses 
himself and used his bow as well.  
Great was the destruction he effected. He 
went about like fire among cotton heaps. 
The formations of both armies were soon 
broken 
and 
indiscriminate 
and 
fierce 
fighting went on. Blood flowed in torrents 
and the field was covered by dead bodies 
of soldiers, elephants and horses and the 
debris of chariots. 
Bhimasena pierced the enemy's lines to 
seek out Duryodhana's brothers and finish 
them. They, for their part, did not wait to 
be sought, but rushed on him, in a 
combined attack from all sides. He was 
attacked 
by 
Duhsasana, 
Durvishaha, 
Durmata, 
Jaya, 
Jayatsena, 
Vikarna, 
Chitrasena, 
Sudarsana, 
Charuchitra, 
Suvarma, 
Dushkarna 
and 
others, 
all 
together.  
Bhimasena, who did not know what fear 
was, stood up and fought them all. They 
desired to take him prisoner and he to kill 
them all on the spot.  
The battle raged fiercely, even like the 
ancient battle between the gods and the 
asuras. Suddenly, the son of Pandu lost his 
patience and jumped down from his 
chariot, mace in band, and made straight 
on foot for the sons of Dhritarashtra, in 
hot haste to slay them. 
When 
Dhrishtadyumna 
saw 
Bhima's 
chariot disappear in the enemy lines, he 
was alarmed and rushed to prevent 
disaster. He reached Bhima's car, but 
found it was occupied only by the 
charioteer and Bhima was not in it. With 
tears in his eyes, he asked the charioteer: 
"Visoka, where is Bhima dearer to me 
than 
life?" 
Dhrishtadyumna 
naturally 
thought Bhima had fallen. 
Visoka bowed and said to the son of 
Drupada: "The son of Pandu asked me to 
stay here and, without waiting for my 
reply rushed forward on foot, mace in 
hand, into the enemy ranks."  
Fearing 
that 
Bhima 
would 
be 
overpowered and killed Dhrishtadyumna 
drove his chariot into the enemy lines in 
search of Bhimasena, whose path was 
marked by the bodies of slain elephants.  
When Dhrishtadyumna found Bhima, he 
saw him surrounded on all sides by 
enemies 
fighting 
from 
their 
chariots. 
Bhima stood against them all, mace in 
hand, wounded all over and breathing fire.  
Dhrishtadyumna embraced him and took 
him into his chariot and proceeded to pick 
out the shafts that had stuck in his body. 
Duryodhana now ordered his warriors to 
attack 
Bhimasena 
and 
Dhrishtadyumna 
and not to wait for them to attack or 
challenge.  
Accordingly, 
they 
made 
a 
combined 
attack even though they were not inclined 
to engage themselves in further fighting. 
Dhrishtadyumna had a secret weapon, 
which he had obtained from Dronacharya 
and, discharging it, threw the enemy 
forces into a stupor.  
But Duryodhana then joined the fray and 
discharged weapons to counter the stupor 
weapons of Dhrishtadyumna. Just then, 
reinforcements 
sent 
by 
Yudhishthira 
arrived.  
A force of twelve chariots with their 
retinue led by Abhimanyu came upon the 
scene to support Bhima.  
Dhrishtadyumna 
was 
greatly 
relieved 
when he saw this. Bhimasena had also by 
now refreshed himself and was ready to 
renew the fight. He got into Kekaya's 
chariot and took up his position along 
with the rest.  
Drona, however, was terrible that day. He 
killed 
Dhrishtadyumna's 
charioteer 
and 
horses and smashed his chariot and 
Drupada's son had to seek a place in 
Abhimanyu's car. The Pandava forces 
began to waver and Drona was cheered by 
the Kaurava army. 
Indiscriminate mass fighting and slaughter 
went on that day. At one time, Bhima and 
Duryodhana met face to face. The usual 
exchange of hot words took place and was 
followed by a great battle of archery.  
Duryodhana was hit and fell unconscious. 
Kripa extricated him with great skill and 
took him away in his own chariot. 
Bhishma personally arrived at the spot 
now and led the attack and scattered the 
Pandava forces.  
The sun was sinking, but the battle was 
continued for an hour yet and the fighting 
was fierce and many thousands perished. 
Then the day's battle ceased. Yudhishthira 
was glad that Dhrishtadyumna and Bhima 
returned to camp alive. 
70. THE SEVENTH DAY 
DURYODHANA, wounded all over and 
suffering greatly, went to Bhishma and 
said:  
"The battle had been going against us 
every day. Our formations are broken and 
our warriors are being slain in large 
numbers. You are looking on doing 
nothing." 
The grandsire soothed Duryodhana with 
comforting words:  
"Why do you let yourself be disheartened? 
Here 
are 
all 
of 
us, 
Drona, 
Salya, 
Kritavarma, 
Aswatthama, 
Vikarna, 
Bhagadatta, Sakuni, the two brothers of 
Avanti, the Trigarta chief, the king of 
Magadha, and Kripacharya. When these 
great warriors are here, ready to give up 
their lives for you, why should you feel 
downhearted? Get rid of this mood of 
dejection." 
Saying this, he issued orders for the day. 
"See 
there," 
the 
grandsire 
said 
to 
Duryodhana. "These thousands of cars, 
horses and horsemen, great war elephants, 
and those 
armed 
foot 
soldiers 
from 
various kingdoms are all ready to fight for 
you. 
With 
this 
fine 
army, 
you 
can 
vanquish even the gods. Fear not."  
Thus 
cheering 
up 
the 
dejected 
Duryodhana, he gave him a healing balm 
for his wounds. Duryodhana rubbed it 
over 
his 
numerous 
wounds 
and 
felt 
relieved. 
He went to the field, heartened by the 
grandsire's words of confidence. The army 
was that day arrayed in circular formation. 
With each war elephant were seven 
chariots fully equipped. 
Each chariot was supported by seven 
horsemen. 
To 
each 
horseman 
were 
attached ten shield bearers. Everyone 
wore armor.  
Duryodhana stood resplendent like Indra 
at the center of this great and well-
equipped army. Yudhishthira arrayed the 
Pandava army in vajravyuha. This day's 
battle was fiercely fought simultaneously 
at many sectors.  
Bhishma 
personally 
opposed 
Arjuna's 
attacks. Drona and Virata were engaged 
with 
each 
other 
at 
another 
point. 
Sikhandin and Aswatthama fought a big 
battle at another sector.  
Duryodhana and Dhrishtadyumna fought 
with each other at yet another point. 
Nakula and Sahadeva attacked their uncle 
Salya. 
The 
Avanti 
kings 
opposed 
Yudhamanyu, while Bhimasena opposed 
Kritavarma, 
Chitrasena, 
Vikarna 
and 
Durmarsha.  
There 
were 
great 
battles 
between 
Ghatotkacha 
and 
Bhagadatta, 
between 
Alambasa 
and 
Satyaki, 
between 
Bhurisravas 
and 
Dhrishtaketu, 
between 
Yudhishthira and Srutayu and between 
Chekitana and Kripa.  
In the battle between Drona and Virata, 
the latter was worsted and he had to climb 
into the chariot of his son Sanga, having 
lost 
his 
own 
chariot, 
horses 
and 
charioteer.  
Virata's sons Uttara and Sveta had fallen 
in the first day's battle. On this seventh 
day, Sanga also was slain just as his father 
came up to his side. Sikhandin, Drupada's 
son, was defeated by Aswatthama.  
His chariot was smashed and he jumped 
down and stood sword and shield in hand. 
Aswatthama aimed his shaft at his sword 
and broke it. Sikhandin then whirled the 
broken sword and hurled it at Aswatthama 
with tremendous force, but it was met by 
Aswatthama's arrow.  
Sikhandin, badly beaten, got into Satyaki's 
chariot and retired. In the fight between 
Satyaki and Alambasa, the former had the 
worst of it at first but later recovered 
ground and Alambasa had to flee. 
In the battle between Dhrishtadyumna and 
Duryodhana, the horses of the latter were 
killed and he had to alight from his 
chariot. He, however, continued the fight, 
sword in hand. Sakuni came then and took 
the prince away in his chariot.  
Kritavarma made a strong attack on 
Bhima but was worsted. He lost his 
chariot and horses and acknowledging 
defeat, fled towards Sakuni's car, with 
Bhima's arrows sticking all over him, 
making 
him 
look 
like 
a 
porcupine 
speeding away in the forest. 
Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti were 
defeated 
by 
Yudhamanyu, 
and 
their 
armies 
were 
completely 
destroyed. 
Bhagadatta attacked Ghatotkacha and put 
to flight all his supporters.  
But, alone, Ghatotkacha stood and fought 
bravely. But in the end, he too had to save 
himself by flight, which gladdened the 
whole Kaurava army. 
Salya attacked his nephews. Nakula's 
horses were killed and he had to join his 
brother 
in 
the 
latter's 
chariot. 
Both 
continued the fight from the same car. 
Salya was hit by Sahadeva's arrow and 
swooned. The charioteer skilfully drove 
the car away and saved Salya.  
When the Madra king (Salya) was seen 
retreating from the field Duryodhana's 
army lost heart and the twin sons of Madri 
blew their conchs in triumph. Taking 
advantage of the situation, they inflicted 
heavy damage on Salya's forces. 
At noon, Yudhishthira led an attack on 
Srutayu. The latter's well-aimed arrows 
intercepted Dharmaputra's missiles, and 
his armor was pierced and he was severely 
wounded. 
Yudhishthira then lost his temper and sent 
a powerful arrow that pierced Srutayu's 
breast-plate. That day, Yudhishthira was 
not his normal self and burnt with anger.  
Srutayu's 
charioteer 
and 
horses 
were 
killed and the chariot was smashed and he 
had to flee on foot from the field. This 
completed 
the 
demorahsation 
of 
Duryodhana's army.  
In the attack on Kripa, Chekitana, losing 
his chariot and charioteer, alighted and 
attacked Kripa's charioteer and horses 
with mace in hand and killed them.  
Kripa also alighted, and standing on the 
ground, discharged his arrows. Chekitana 
was badly hit. He then whirled his mace 
and hurled it at Kripacharya, but the latter 
was able to intercept it with his own 
arrow.  
Thereupon they closed with each other, 
sword in hand. Both were wounded and 
fell on the ground, when Bhima came and 
took 
Chekitana away in his chariot. 
Sakuni similarly took wounded Kripa 
away in his car.  
Ninety-six arrows of Dhrishtaketu struck 
Bhurisravas. And the great warrior was 
like a sun radiating glory, as the arrows, 
all sticking in his breast-plate, shone 
bright around his radiant face. Even in 
that condition, he compelled Dhrishtaketu 
to admit defeat and retire.  Three of 
Duryodhana's 
brothers 
attacked 
Abhimanyu who inflicted a heavy defeat 
on them but spared their lives, because 
Bhima had sworn to kill them. Thereupon, 
Bhishma attacked Abhimanyu. 
Arjuna saw this and said to his illustrious 
charioteer: "Krishna, drive the car towards 
Bhishma." 
At that moment, the other Pandavas also 
joined Arjuna. But the grandsire was able 
to hold his own against all five until the 
sunset, and the battle was suspended for 
the day. And the warriors of both sides, 
weary and wounded, retired to their tents 
for rest and for having their injuries 
attended to. 
After this, for an hour, soft music was 
played, soothing the warriors to their rest. 
That hour was spent, says the poet, 
without a word about war or hatred. It was 
an hour of heavenly bliss, and it was a 
glad sight to see. One can see herein what 
the great lesson of the Mahabharata is. 
71. THE EIGHTH DAY 
WHEN the eighth day dawned, Bhishma 
arrayed his army in tortoise formation. 
Yudhishthira said to Dhrishtadyumna: 
"See there, the enemy is in kurma vyuha 
(tortoise formation). You have to answer 
at once with a formation that can break it." 
Dhrishtadyumna 
immediately 
proceeded 
to his task. The Pandava forces were 
arrayed in a three-pronged formation.  
Bhima was at the head of one prong, 
Satyaki of another, and Yudhishthira at 
the crest of the middle division. Our 
ancestors had developed the science of 
war very well.  
It was not reduced to writing but was 
preserved by tradition in the families of 
kshatriyas. 
Armor 
and 
tactics 
were 
employed suitably to meet the weapons of 
offence and the tactics that the enemy 
used in those days. 
The Kurukshetra battle was fought some 
thousands of years ago. Reading the story 
of the battle in the Mahabharata, we 
should 
not, 
having 
the 
practice 
and 
incidents of modern warfare in mind, 
reject the Mahabharata narrative as mere 
myth with no relation to fact.  
Only about a century and a half ago, the 
English admiral Nelson fought great sea 
battles and won undying renown.  
The weapons used and the vessels that 
actually took part in Nelson's battles, 
would seem almost weird and even 
ridiculous if compared with those of 
modern naval warfare.  
If a hundred and fifty years can make so 
much difference, we must be prepared for 
very strange things in the procedure and 
events of a period, so long back as that of 
the Mahabharata war. 
Another matter to be kept in mind is that 
we cannot expect, in the books of poets 
and literary writers, accurate or full details 
about weapons and tactics, although the 
narrative may be of battles.  
Military affairs were in ancient times the 
sole concern of the military order, the 
kshatriyas. Their culture and their training 
were entirely their own charge.  
The principles and the secrets of warfare 
and the science and art of the use of 
military weapons were handed down from 
generation to generation by tradition and 
personal instruction.  
There were no military textbooks and 
there was not any place for them in the 
works of poets and rishis. If a modern 
novel deals in some chapters with the 
treatment and cure of a sick person, we 
can not expect to see such details in it as 
might interest a medical man. No author 
would care, even if he were able, to 
include scientific details in his story.  
So, we cannot hope to find in the epic of 
Vyasa, precise details as to what is 
tortoise formation or lotus formation. We 
have no explanation as to how one could, 
by discharging a continuous stream of 
arrows, build a defence around himself or 
intercept and cut missiles in transit, or 
how one could be living when pierced all 
over by arrows, or how far the armor worn 
by the soldiers and officers could protect 
them against missiles or what were the 
ambulance arrangements or how the dead 
were disposed of.  
All these things appertaining to ancient 
war, however interesting, will have to be 
in the realm of the unknown in spite of the 
vivid 
narrative 
we 
have 
in 
the 
Mahabharata epic. 
Bhima killed eight of Dhritarashtra's sons 
early in the battle that day. Duryodhana's 
heart lost courage before this. It seemed to 
his 
friends 
as 
if 
Bhimasena 
would 
complete his revenge this very day, even 
as he swore in the assembly ball, where 
the great outrage was enacted.  
Arjuna had a great bereavement in this 
day's battle. His dear son Iravan was 
killed. This son of Arjuna by his Naga 
wife had come and joined the Pandava 
forces at Kurukshetra. Duryodhana sent 
his friend, the Rakshasa Alambasa, to 
oppose the Naga warrior. 
Iravan was slain after a fierce fight. When 
Arjuna 
heard 
this, 
he 
broke 
down 
completely. Said he turning to Vasudeva: 
"Vidura had indeed told us plainly that 
both sides would be plunged in grief 
unbearable. What are we doing all this 
wretched destruction up on one another 
for? Just for the sake of property. After all 
this killing, what joy are we or they likely 
to find in the end? O Madhusudana, I now 
see why the far seeing Yudhishthira said 
he would be content if Duryodhana would 
give 
five 
villages 
to 
us, 
keeping 
everything else to himself and he would 
not resort to fighting if that were agreed 
to. Duryodhana, in his obstinate folly, 
refused to give even these five villages 
and so, these great sins have to be 
committed on both sides. I continue 
fighting 
only 
because 
men 
would 
otherwise think me a coward, who could 
submit tamely to wrong. When I see the 
dead warriors lying on the field, my heart 
is filled with unbearable anguish. Oh, how 
wicked we are to carry on in this 
miserable, sinful way." 
Seeing Iravan killed, Ghatotkacha uttered 
a loud war-cry which made all the 
assembled soldiers tremble. And with his 
division, he fell upon the Kaurava army 
ferociously. So great was the destruction 
he wrought that at many points the 
Kaurava formation was broken.  
Seeing this, Duryodhana personally led an 
attack on Bhima's son. The king of Vanga 
joined Duryodhana with his elephants. 
Duryodhana fought most bravely on this 
eighth day of the battle. He killed a great 
number of warriors on Ghatotkacha's side.  
Ghatotkacha hurled a javelin which would 
have ended Duryodhana's career but for 
the Vanga chief's prompt intervention 
with one of his elephants.  
The missile hit the beast, which fell dead, 
and Duryodhana was saved.  
Bhishma was anxious about Duryodhana 
and sent a large force under Drona to 
support the Kaurava prince.  
Many were the veterans who were in this 
force that attacked Ghatotkacha.  
So tumultuous and fierce was the fight at 
this sector of the battle that Yudhishthira 
feared for Ghatotkacha's safety and sent 
Bhimasena to his aid.  
Then the battle became even fiercer than 
before. Sixteen of Duryodhana's brothers 
perished on this day. 
72. THE NINTH DAY 
ON the morning of the ninth day, before 
the 
battle 
began, 
Duryodhana 
was 
closeted with the grandsire. He gave vent 
to his bitter feelings of disappointment 
over the way the battle was going. He 
uttered words that were like the sharp 
spears and pained the grandsire greatly 
but the latter was patient and said sadly: 
"Like ghee on the sacrificial fire I am 
pouring my life out for you. Why do you 
seek to mortify me, who have been doing 
my very utmost for you? You speak like a 
man of no understanding, not knowing 
what is right and what is wrong. They say 
that, when a man is nearing his death, the 
tree appears to him to be made of gold. 
You see things now, not as they are. Your 
vision is clouded. You are now reaping 
the harvest of the hatred you deliberately 
sowed. The best course for you are to go 
on fighting, as well as you can. This is 
also the plain path of duty. It is not 
possible for me to fight Sikhandin, for I 
can never raise my hand against a woman. 
Nor can I with my hands kill the 
Pandavas, for my mind revolts against it. I 
will do everything barring these two and 
fight all the warriors opposed to you. 
Nothing is gained by losing heart. Fight as 
a kshatriya should and honor will be yours 
whatever the events."  
Saying thus to Duryodhana and cheering 
him up with wise and affectionate words, 
Bhishma proceeded to issue instructions 
for arraying the forces for the day's battle.  
Duryodhana was heartened. He sent for 
Duhsasana and said to him: "Brother, put 
forth all our strength in today's battle. I am 
convinced, the grandsire is fighting on our 
side with his whole heart. It is only 
against Sikhandin, he says, he cannot use 
his weapons. We should see that he is not 
exposed to Sikhandin's attacks, for you 
know, even a wild dog can kill a lion if 
the latter scorns to fight back." 
There 
was 
a 
great 
fight 
between 
Abhimanyu 
and 
Alambasa. 
Abhimanyu 
demonstrated that his valor was no less 
than his illustrious father's. Alambasa had 
to flee on foot to save himself.  
There 
were 
fierce 
combats 
between 
Satyaki and Aswatthama and between 
Drona and Arjuna. Thereafter, all the 
Pandavas 
attacked 
the 
grandsire 
and 
Duryodhana sent Duhsasana to support 
the old warrior. Bhishma fought furiously 
and beat the Pandavas back.  
The 
Pandava 
forces 
were 
thoroughly 
demoralised and were flying hither and 
thither, like cattle that had lost their way 
in the forest.  
Krishna halted the chariot and said to 
Arjuna: "Partha, you and your brothers 
were looking forward to this day, after 
thirteen years. Do not hesitate to kill the 
grandsire. 
Remember 
the 
duty 
of 
a 
soldier." 
Arjuna bent his head down and, without 
looking up, replied: "I would much rather 
have continued to be an exile in the forest 
than kill the grandsire and the teachers 
whom I love, but I shall obey you. Drive 
on." 
Arjuna's heart was not in the fight. 
Unwillingly and in great distress of mind, 
he proceeded to the combat. Bhishma, on 
the other hand, burnt fiercely like the 
noonday sun. 
When the army saw Arjuna's chariot 
proceed towards Bhishma, it regained 
courage and order once again prevailed. 
Bhishma's arrows came thick and fast and 
covered 
the 
advancing 
chariot 
so 
completely 
that 
neither 
horses 
nor 
vehicles could be seen.  
Krishna was unperturbed and drove on 
with circumspection and skill. Arjuna's 
shafts hit Bhishma's bow and shattered it 
many times. But the grandsire went on 
renewing his weapon. 
"You are not fighting, Arjuna, as you 
should!" exclaimed Krishna, and jumped 
down in a rage from the chariot and, 
taking up his discus, he advanced towards 
the grandsire.  
Bhishma saw Vasudeva approaching. 
"Hail, O Lotus-eyed One!" he cried. 
"Blessed am I to be separated from the 
body by you! Come, come!"  
Arjuna jumped down from the chariot 
and, rushing forward overtook and held 
Krishna, casting both his arms around 
him. "Stop, Krishna," he cried. "Do not 
break your pledge. You have promised not 
to use weapons in this battle. This is my 
work. I shall not fail. I shall send my 
arrows and kill the beloved grandsire 
myself. Pray, mount the car and take the 
reins." 
Arjuna took Krishna back and the battle 
was resumed. The Pandava forces had 
been handled roughly, but now the sun 
was down in the west and the fighting 
ended for the day. 
73. THE PASSING OF BHISHMA 
IT was the tenth day of the battle. Keeping 
Sikhandin in front of him, Arjuna attacked 
Bhishma. When Sikhandin's darts pierced 
his breast, sparks flew from the grandsire's 
eyes.  
For a moment the old warrior's anger rose 
like flaming fire and his eyes glared as if 
to consume Sikhandin. But, at once, the 
grandsire restrained himself.  
He decided not to be provoked into 
fighting Sikhandin, who was born a 
woman and to strike whom it seemed 
unworthy of a warrior. 
He knew, however, his end was near and 
calmed 
himself. 
Sikhandin 
went 
on 
discharging his arrows, not minding the 
battle of emotions in his opponent's mind.  
Arjuna also steeled his heart, and from 
behind Sikhandin aimed arrows at the 
weak points in Bhishma's armor, even 
while the grandsire stood still. 
Bhishma smiled as the arrows continued 
to come down thick on him, and turning to 
Duhsasana, said: "Ah, these are Arjuna's 
arrows! These cannot be Sikhandin's, for 
they burn my flesh as the crab's young 
ones tear their mother's body."  
Thus did the grandsire look upon his dear 
pupil's arrows and, while saying this to 
Duhsasana, he took up a javelin and 
hurled it at Arjuna. Arjuna met it with 
three arrows which cut it to pieces  even 
as it was speeding through the air.  
Bhishma then decided to end the combat 
and made as if to dismount from his 
chariot, sword and shield in hand. But 
before he could do so, his shield was cut 
to pieces by Arjuna's arrows.  
With arrows sticking all over his body so 
thickly that there was not even an inch of 
intervening space, Bhishma fell headlong 
to the ground from his chariot.  
As he fell, the gods, who looked on from 
above, folded their hands in reverent 
salutation and a gentle breeze, laden with 
fragrance and cool raindrops, swept over 
the battlefield. 
Thus fell the great and good Bhishma, the 
son of Ganga, who came on earth to 
hallow it and all it bears.  
The blameless hero who, unasked, made 
the great renunciation to give joy to his 
father. The undefeated bowman who had 
humbled the pride of Rama of the axe. 
The selfless worker for righteousness' 
sake, thus repaid his debt to Duryodhana, 
and lay wounded to death sanctifying with 
his 
life-blood 
the 
battlefield. 
As 
the 
grandsire fell, the hearts of the Kauravas 
also fell along with him. 
Bhishma's body did not touch the ground, 
on account of the arrows sticking out all 
over his body. His body shone more 
brightly than ever before, as it lay as on a 
bed of honor, supported by the shafts that 
had pierced his flesh.  
Both armies ceased fighting and all the 
warriors came running and crowded round 
the great hero, who lay on his bed of 
arrows. The kings of the earth stood with 
bowed heads round him, as the gods 
round Brahma. 
"My head hangs down unsupported," said 
the grandsire. The princes who stood near, 
ran and brought cushions. The old warrior 
rejected them with a smile and, turning 
towards Arjuna said: "Dear son Partha, 
give me a cushion befitting a warrior." 
When Arjuna, whose arrows were just 
then burning the grandsire's flesh, heard 
those words addressed to him, he took 
three arrows from out of his quiver and so 
placed them that the grandsire's head 
found support on their points.  
"Princes," said Bhishma addressing the 
assembled chiefs, "Arjuna's arrows were 
indeed what my head required to be 
supported 
on. 
This 
pillow 
gives 
me 
satisfaction. Now, I must lie thus until the 
sun turns north. My soul will not depart 
till then. When I pass away, those of you 
who may be alive then may come and see 
me." 
Then the grandsire turned again to Arjuna 
and said: "I am tormented with thirst. Get 
me some drinking water." At once, Arjuna 
raised his bow, and drawing, it to the ear, 
shot a shaft down into the earth near the 
grandsire on his right side. 
Upon the opening made by the arrow, 
there gushed a stream of pure sweet water 
to the very lips of the dying man. Ganga 
came up, says the poet, to quench her dear 
son's burning thirst. Bhishma drank and 
was happy. 
"Duryodhana, may you be wise!" said 
Bhishma, addressing the Kaurava prince. 
"Did you see how Arjuna brought me 
water to quench my thirst? Who else in 
this world can do such a deed? Make 
peace with him without further delay. 
May the war cease with my exit. Listen to 
me, son, make peace with the Pandavas." 
The grandsire's words did not please 
Duryodhana. 
Even 
when 
dying, 
the 
patient does not like medicine. He objects 
to the bitter taste. All the princes retired to 
their camps. 
74. KARNA AND THE GRANDSIRE 
WHEN 
he 
learnt 
that 
Bhishma 
lay 
wounded and dying, Karna hurried to the 
place and fell at his feet and said: 
"Eldest of the race. Radha's son, who, 
through no fault of his, incurred your 
great 
displeasure, 
humbly 
prostrates 
himself before you." 
When after humble salutation Karna stood 
up, the grandsire, greatly moved, tenderly 
placed his hand on Karna's head and 
blessed him. 
"You are not Radha's son, young man," he 
said in loving tones: "You are Kuntidevi's 
own first born. Narada, who knows all the 
secrets of the world, himself revealed this 
to me. Son of Surya, truly I entertained no 
dislike for you. But I was grieved to see 
your increasing hatred of the Pandavas 
although they gave you no cause for it. I 
know and admire your valor and your 
open handedness. And I know also that 
you belong to the class of Phalguna and 
Krishna in prowess. It is proper that you 
befriend the Pandavas. Therein lies the 
right path for you who are their brother. 
With the closing of my part in this war, 
may the chapter of your enmity also close. 
This is my wish, Karna."  
Karna listened respectfully and replied: 
"Grandsire I know I am Kunti's son, and 
not charioteer born. But I have eaten 
Duryodhana's salt and must be true to 
him, to be true to my own lineage. It is 
impossible for me to go over to the 
Pandavas now. You must permit me to 
repay with my life, if it so be the debt I 
owe to Duryodhana for his love and trust. 
I have erred greatly in word and deed. 
You must forgive me for it all and give 
me your blessings." 
The great acharya, who knew all the laws 
of right conduct and what Karna said, 
replied: "Do reflect for a while and then 
do as you wish, for that is the right way." 
Even 
when 
Bhishma 
was 
mortally 
wounded and lay dying, the battle did not 
cease. Discarding the grandsire's words of 
wisdom, the Kauravas resumed the battle. 
Deprived of Bhishma's leadership, the 
Kaurava forces felt like sheep without a 
shepherd when Bhishma no longer led 
them. 
Indeed, 
even 
as 
Bhishma 
fell 
wounded, the men shouted: 
"O Karna, you are the one left to lead and 
protect us."  
The Kaurava warriors felt that, if but 
Karna would agree to take up the 
command, victory was certain. During the 
first ten days when Bhishma led the 
forces, the son of Surya kept away from 
the battle.  
As already narrated, deeply hurt at the 
grandsire's contempt, Karna had said: "So 
long as you are up fighting, I shall keep 
aloof. If you slay the Pandavas and bring 
victory to Duryodhana, I shall be glad. 
And I shall then, taking the king's leave, 
go to the forest. But, if you be defeated 
and go to the abode of the brave, I who 
am not deemed by you as an adhiratha 
(master of chariot warfare) will ride my 
chariot and oppose those whom you deem 
to be of greater prowess than myself. And 
defeating 
them, 
bring 
victory 
to 
Duryodhana." 
Thus 
had 
Karna 
sworn 
and, 
with 
Duryodhana's consent, kept aloof from the 
battle during the first ten days. Now he 
went on foot to Bhishma who lay on his 
bed of arrows waiting for his end and, 
saluting him, addressed him thus:  
"Veteran 
grandsire, 
vanquisher 
of 
Parasurama, you lie on the field of battle, 
struck down by Sikhandin. If you, who 
had reached the summit of right living and 
were an embodiment of purity itself, must 
lie wounded in this manner, it is clear that 
no one can attain in this world what he 
deserves by his merit. You were the one 
boat 
on 
which 
the 
Kaurava 
princes 
depended for crossing the flood of their 
troubles. Heavy indeed will be the blows 
that the Pandavas will now deal at the 
Kauravas 
and 
great 
will 
be 
their 
consequent distress. Like fire and wind 
burning down the forest, Arjuna and 
Krishna 
will 
destroy 
the 
army 
of 
Kauravas. This is certain. Turn your 
gracious eyes on me and bless me, who 
have accepted the command of 
the 
forces." 
Bhishma 
gave 
his 
blessings 
to 
Karna."You are like the good earth to the 
seeds, like rain clouds to living beings, 
ever dependable, firm in your loyalty. 
Serve Duryodhana and save him. You 
vanquished the Kambojas for him. You 
put down the Kiratas of the Himalayan 
fastnesses 
for 
him. 
You 
fought 
the 
Girivrajas on his behalf and defeated 
them. 
Many 
more 
things 
you 
have 
accomplished for him. Take charge of the 
Kaurava army now as your own rich 
possession and guard it well. May you 
lead Duryodhana's forces to success! May 
you have every good fortune! Fight your 
enemies, go."  
Karna, having received the benediction of 
the grandsire, mounted his chariot and 
rode to the battlefield. When the valorous 
Karna entered the field on his war chariot, 
Duryodhana's joys knew no bounds. His 
sorrow, at having lost Bhishma, was in 
some degree alleviated.  
75. DRONA IN COMMAND 
DURYODHANA and Karna held counsel 
as to who should be put in supreme 
command of the forces. 
"Well, everyone of these princely warriors 
fighting on your side is great enough to be 
put in charge of our forces as supreme 
commander," said Karna.  
"All these kings are of equal prowess, 
strength, energy, skill, courage, valor, 
ancestry and wisdom. They cannot all be 
put in joint command and, if any of them 
be chosen, each of the others would feel 
hurt and may not put forth his whole 
strength in the cause. Thereby we stand to 
suffer. So, my advice is that we install 
Dronacharya, the teacher of all these 
princes 
and 
warriors, 
as 
supreme 
commander. He indeed is the greatest of 
all those that carry arms today. No 
kshatriya 
equals 
him 
in 
the 
qualities 
required for leading our army. Let us 
therefore install him." 
Duryodhana agreed that this was the right 
thing to do, and so it was decided. 
Duryodhana went to Dronacharya and, in 
the presence of the assembled warriors 
and princes, bowed and addressed him:  
"Revered 
Master, 
you 
are 
unrivalled 
among all those assembled here in caste, 
ancestry, knowledge of sciences, age, 
wisdom, valor and skill. I beg of you to 
accept the supreme command. Under your 
command, this army will be victorious." 
The 
assembled 
kings 
received 
this 
proposal with loud cheers and war cries 
that gladdened Duryodhana's heart. 
Drona was installed in due form amidst 
thunderous acclamation. The praise of 
courtiers and the sound of trumpets that 
accompanied the ceremony, made the 
Kauravas feel as though they had already 
vanquished the enemy. So great was their 
enthusiasm and confidence in Drona's 
leadership.  
Drona 
arrayed 
the 
army 
in 
circular 
formation. Karna, who had till then stood 
aside was now seen moving about in his 
great chariot on the battlefield and this put 
new courage and joy into the hearts of the 
Kaurava soldiers.  
The talk went round in the army that the 
great Bhishma did not wish to slay the 
sons of Pandu and therefore had not put 
his whole heart in the fight. But now that 
Karna was in the field, it was certain that 
the Pandavas would be destroyed.  
Dronacharya was in command for five 
days of the battle. Though of advanced 
years, he was everywhere in the field and 
displayed the fierce energy of a young 
warrior. Whenever he led an attack, the 
Pandava forces were scattered like clouds 
before a storm.  
He 
personally 
engaged 
the 
greatest 
warriors on the Pandava side in battle. He 
fought 
Satyaki, 
Bhima, 
Arjuna, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
Abhimanyu, 
Drupada 
and Kasiraja and defeated them on many 
occasions.  
He 
harassed 
and 
inflicted 
severe 
punishment on the Pandava army during 
the five days he was in command. 
76. TO SEIZE YUDHISHTHIRA 
ALIVE 
AS SOON AS Drona assumed command 
of the Kaurava forces Duryodhana, Karna 
and Duhsasana sat in council and decided 
on a plan. And Duryodhana went to 
Dronacharya to put it in operation. 
"Acharya, we desire that you should 
capture Yudhishthira alive and give him 
over to us. We desire nothing more, not 
even a total victory. If you achieve this for 
us, we shall all be exceedingly satisfied 
with your conduct of the war." 
When Drona heard Duryodhana address 
him thus, great was his joy, for he hated 
the very idea of slaying the Pandava 
brothers. 
Even 
though, 
to 
fulfil 
his 
obligation, the acharya loyally joined the 
Kaurava side against the Pandavas, he 
loved the sons of Kunti and especially the 
pure-minded Yudhishthira.  
So, when he heard Duryodhana request 
that 
Yudhishthira 
should 
be 
captured 
alive, he felt greatly relieved.  
"Duryodhana, may you be blessed!" the 
acharya said. "Do you too wish to abstain 
from 
killing 
Yudhishthira? 
How 
it 
gladdens my heart! Truly, Yudhishthira is 
one without an enemy and the name 
Ajatasatru, which the people have given to 
Kunti's eldest son, has been justified by 
your great decision. When even you have 
made up your mind that he should not be 
killed but should be captured alive, his 
unrivalled glory has become ten times 
enhanced." 
"I 
see, 
dear 
Duryodhana, 
what 
you 
intend," Drona continued. "You wish to 
defeat the Pandavas in battle and then give 
them their share in the kingdom and live 
in peace and amity with them. I see this 
clearly 
from 
your 
desire 
to 
capture 
Yudhishthira alive." 
Drona was exceedingly glad and he said 
again: "Indeed Yudhishthira is the most 
fortunate man on earth. The gods are 
showering their favors on Kunti's good 
son. So has he won the hearts of even 
enemies." 
But Duryodhana's motives in wishing to 
take Yudhishthira alive were far different. 
And as soon as Drona acceded to his 
proposal and gave his pledge that he 
would do his best to capture Yudhishthira, 
he began to reveal his real intentions. 
If Yudhishthira were slain, nothing would 
be gained by it, and the anger of the 
Pandavas would be all the greater. The 
battle would rage more fiercely than 
before. And Duryodhana knew that it 
would only mean the utter defeat of his 
army.  
Even if the fight were to be continued 
relentlessly 
until 
both 
armies 
were 
destroyed, Krishna would still remain 
alive and he would put either Draupadi or 
Kunti in sovereign possession of the 
kingdom.  
What then was the point in killing 
Yudhishthira? 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if 
Yudhishthira 
was 
captured 
alive, 
Duryodhana thought, the war would end 
more speedily and victoriously for the 
Kauravas.  
Thereafter, 
he 
could 
surely 
play 
on 
Yudhishthira's goodness and his loyalty to 
the traditional code of kshatriya conduct. 
It was pretty certain he could be drawn 
into the battle of dice again and sent to the 
forests once more.  
Ten days of fighting had demonstrated to 
Duryodhana that further fighting would 
only result in the destruction of the race, 
not the fulfilment of the desires. 
When Duryodhana made his motives clear 
to 
Drona, 
the 
acharya 
was 
greatly 
disappointed and he cursed Duryodhana in 
his heart. But whatever the reason for it, 
he was glad that Yudhishthira was not to 
be killed. 
The news that Drona had given a solemn 
assurance to Duryodhana that he would 
take Yudhishthir a prisoner, was carried 
by their spies to the Pandava army.  
The Pandavas 
knew 
that, 
when 
the 
acharya was determined on something and 
gave his pledged word for executing it, his 
unrivalled eminence in the art of war and 
his valor made it a most serious affair.  
So, they soon got busy and so arrayed the 
forces that Yudhishthira was never left 
unsupported. Whatever movements might 
take place, they always took care to leave 
sufficient protection against any surprise 
attack on Yudhishthira. 
In 
the 
first 
day's 
battle 
under 
the 
leadership of Drona, the acharya amply 
demonstrated his great skill and energy. 
He moved about destroying the Pandava 
forces like a fire burning up dry logs. His 
rapid movements made the Pandava army 
feel as if Drona was everywhere at the 
same time showering arrows like rain and 
converting the battlefield into a stage for 
the dance of the God of Death. He cut the 
Pandava 
army 
in 
twain 
where 
Dhrishtadyumna stood.  
Many were the single combats among 
renowned warriors. There was a fierce 
battle 
between 
Sahadeva 
and 
Sakuni 
skilled in illusion warfare. When their 
chariots broke, they alighted on the 
ground. And, like two hills sprung to life 
and motion, they struck each other with 
maces and closed with one another in 
single 
combat. 
Between 
Bhima 
and 
Vivimsati there was a great battle in 
which chariots were broken on both sides. 
Salya fought his nephew Nakula and 
harassed him exceedingly, smiling most 
provokingly all the time. But, in the end, 
Salya had his car smashed and his flag 
brought down, and he withdrew admitting 
defeat. 
Between 
Kripacharya 
and 
Dhrishtaketu there was a battle in which 
the latter was worsted.  
So also was there fierce fighting between 
Satyaki and Kritavarma and between 
Virata and Karna. Abhimanyu's valor was 
also demonstrated as he fought Paurava, 
Kritavarma, Jayadratha and Salya single-
handed and made them withdraw.  
Then there was a great combat between 
Salya and Bhimasena in which Salya was 
defeated and made to retire. The Kaurava 
forces began to lose courage and the 
Pandava army, who saw this, attacked the 
Kaurava army with renewed energy and 
broke its ranks. 
 When Drona saw this, he decided to 
restore lost morale by leading a straight 
attack on Yudhishthira. His golden chariot 
went forward, drawn by four noble Sindhu 
horses, in the direction of Yudhishthira. 
Yudhishthira 
answered 
with 
barbed 
arrows, feathered with eagle-feathers. But 
Drona did not mind, and advanced at great 
speed. Yudhishthira's bow was cut down 
and Drona was coming very near.  
Dhrishtadyumna tried to intercept Drona 
but in vain. The whole army shouted: 
"Yudhishthira has been taken!" So near 
came Drona. 
Suddenly, then, Arjuna appeared on the 
battlefield, the earth rumbling under the 
wheels of his chariot, as it coursed swiftly 
over the bloody field, over bones and 
bodies lying in heaps. Drona held back, 
for Arjuna had come on the scene. From 
his Gandiva bow issued a continuous 
stream of arrows. No one could see the 
shafts taken out of the quiver or placed in 
position. It seemed as if, from out of the 
great bow, an unending flood of arrows 
issued 
without 
intermission. 
The 
battlefield 
was 
darkened 
by 
flying 
missiles.  
Drona retreated. Yudhishthira was not 
taken. The battle was stopped for the day 
and the Kaurava forces went to their camp 
in chastened mood.  
The Pandava army marched proudly to 
camp and behind them walked Kesava 
(Krishna) and Arjuna conversing. Thus 
closed the eleventh day of the battle. 
77. THE TWELFTH DAY 
THE attempt to capture Yudhishthira alive 
failed. 
Drona 
was 
speaking 
to 
Duryodhana about this. "It is clear we 
cannot succeed in our efforts to seize 
Yudhishthira so long as Dhananjaya is 
nearby. It is no want of interest on my 
part. If by some stratagem we could draw 
Arjuna away to some other part of the 
field, 
I 
could 
pierce 
the 
Pandava 
formations and capture Yudhishthira. I 
promise to seize him and deliver him to 
you provided he does not flee from the 
battle, renouncing honor. If he does that, 
then also we win indeed, do we not?" 
The chief of the Trigartadesa who heard 
Drona say this talked it over with his 
brothers, and they made a plan. They 
resolved to take the samsaptaka oath and 
challenge Arjuna to battle and draw him 
away from Yudhishthira's side. 
Accordingly, together with a large force, 
they gathered, and sat before the fire, 
dressed in matted grass, and went through 
funeral 
gifts 
and 
ceremonies 
for 
themselves as if already dead, and took 
their oath: "Not till we have killed 
Dhananjaya will we turn back. If we flee 
in fear from battle, may we be punished as 
for deadly sin!" 
Having adjured themselves thus before the 
sacred fire, they marched south for that 
was the direction of Death, and shouted 
"O Arjuna!" challenging him to battle.  
It was a great suicide squad organized to 
achieve what Drona had pointed out to be 
essential. Arjuna turned to Yudhishthira 
and 
addressed 
him 
thus: 
"King, 
the 
samsaptakas are calling me to battle. I am 
pledged to accept a challenge thus thrown 
out. Susarma and his men are calling me 
to battle. I shall destroy them all and 
return. Permit me to go." 
"Brother 
beloved," 
said 
Yudhishthira, 
"you know Drona's intentions. Keep that 
in mind and do whatever you think fit. He 
has promised Duryodhana to take me 
alive. He is a matchless warrior, brave, 
strong and skilled in, every branch of 
archery. He knows no fatigue and nothing 
escapes his watchful eyes." 
"King, here is Satyajit, standing in support 
of you," replied Arjuna. "As long as he is 
alive and by you, nothing can happen to 
you." 
So 
saying 
Arjuna 
asked 
the 
Panchala prince Satyajit to stand guard by 
Yudhishthira's side and marched off like a 
hungry lion to meet the samsaptakas.  
"There, 
Krishna, 
see 
the 
Trigartas 
standing, cheerful under the intoxication 
of their oath, though they know they go to 
certain death. Indeed they are full of the 
exultation of approaching swarga." So 
speaking to his great charioteer, Arjuna 
approached the large samsaptaka force.  
This was the Twelfth Day of the great 
battle. It was a fierce fight. After a time, 
Arjuna's attack began to tell and the 
Trigartas fell in swathes before him but 
Susarma reminded them of their oath. 
"Heroes, we have taken our oaths before 
the fire and in the presence of the whole 
army of warriors. Having sworn terrible 
resolves, it is unworthy to flinch. Let us 
not 
fall 
into 
public 
ridicule." 
The 
samsaptakas cheered their leader, and 
faced Arjuna with the sublime courage of 
accepted deaths.  
"Hrishikesa, they are resolved on fighting 
to the last. Drive on," said Arjuna. 
Driven 
by 
Madhusudana 
(Krishna) 
Arjuna's chariot moved like Indra's car in 
the great war of the gods against the 
asuras. It went here and it went there and 
wherever it went, Arjuna's great bow, the 
Gandiva, 
scattered 
death 
among 
the 
doomed Trigartas.  
The burst of blood in their compct ranks 
was like the burst of Palasa blossoms in a 
springtime 
forest. 
The 
fighting 
was 
severe. At one time Arjuna's car and 
flagpole were immersed in darkness under 
the downpour of arrows.  
"Are you alive, Dhananjaya?" shouted 
Krishna.  
"Yes," replied Arjuna, and pulling the 
string of his Gandiva, discharged shafts 
that dispelled the arrow-shower. It was 
like the Rudra dance of dissolution. The 
field was full of severed limbs and 
headless bodies and presented a terrible 
spectacle. 
As Arjuna proceeded to oppose the 
samsaptakas, Drona gave orders for a 
violent assault on the Pandava forces at 
the point where Yudhishthira stood.  
Yudhishthira 
saw 
this 
movement 
and 
spoke 
to 
the 
Panchala 
prince 
Dhrishtadyumna: 
"The brahmana is coming to seize me. 
Look after the forces with vigilance." 
The son of Drupada did not wait for 
Drona to advance but marched forward in 
his 
car 
himself 
to 
meet 
Drona. 
Dronacharya 
avoided 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
for well he knew that his death was 
destined to be at his hands and that death 
was not yet due. And he wheeled his 
chariot 
in 
another 
direction 
where 
Drupada was leading his forces.  
Drupada's 
forces 
suffered 
heavy 
punishment at Drona's hands and blood 
flowed in streams on the battlefield. 
Drona, then, again turned his attention to 
Yudhishthira. The Pandavas stood firm 
and 
answered 
Drona's 
attacks 
with 
showers of arrows.  
Satyajit made a charge on Drona's car and 
there was a fierce combat in which 
Drona's figure assumed the grimness of 
the Destroyer. Many a warrior was slain 
by him in succession. Vrika, a prince of 
Panchala, as well as Satyajit, fell dead.  
Seeing this, Satanika, son of Virata, 
marched against Drona. In a moment, 
Satanika's severed head rolled on the 
ground with the golden kundalas shining 
in the earlobes.  
Ketama, another chief, followed the attack 
but he too perished. Then, Vasudhana 
rushed forward to stop the advance of 
Drona, but he too fell dead. Yudhamanyu, 
Satyaki, Sikhandin and Uttamaujas who 
came to push Drona back, were repulsed 
and all these great warriors had to retreat. 
Drona was now almost within reach of 
Yudhishthira. 
At that moment, Panchalya, another son 
of Drupada, rushed madly up to stop the 
acharya and fought most desperately. But, 
he too was mortally wounded and fell 
from his chariot like a failing star. 
Then, Duryodhana was delighted and said 
exultingly to Karna: 
"Radheya, do you see the valor of our 
mighty leader? No more will the Pandavas 
be inclined towards battle. See how their 
army reels under Drona's blows." 
Karna shook his head. "Do not be so 
confident," he said. "The Pandavas are not 
to be so easily vanquished. They will 
never surrender. The wrongs they have 
undergone are too great to be forgotten. 
You tried to poison and kill them. You 
tried to burn them alive. You have grieved 
and humiliated them at the game of dice 
and you have forced them out to live in 
the forest for long years. They will not 
surrender. See there, their army has rallied 
and all their forces are leading a combined 
attack on Drona. There, see Bhima, 
Satyaki, 
Yudhamanyu, 
Kshatradharma, 
Nakula, 
Uttamaujas, 
Drupada, 
Virata, 
Sikhandin. 
Dhrishtaketu 
and 
other 
warriors 
have 
all 
come 
to 
protect 
Yudhishthira and are pressing Drona hard. 
We should not stand idly watching, when 
we have put such a heavy burden on the 
acharya. Great as he is, there is a limit to 
the load even he can carry. Even wolves 
combined in large numbers can harass and 
kill a mighty elephant, Let us proceed. It 
will not do any longer to leave Drona 
unsupported."  
78. BRAVE BHAGADATTA 
DRONA made many attempts to take 
Yudhishthira 
prisoner, 
but 
failed. 
Duryodhana led a large elephant division 
against Bhima. Bhima defended himself 
from his chariot with well-aimed arrows.  
He sent crescent-headed shafts and tore 
down Duryodhana's flag and cut down his 
bow even as he held it in his hand. Seeing 
the king harassed in this manner, the 
Mlechchha king Anga marched against 
Bhimasena seated on a huge elephant.  
But Bhima sent shafts that laid the 
elephant low and killed the Mlechchha 
king, which resulted in scattering that 
section of the Kaurava forces in fear and 
confusion. 
When 
the 
elephants 
stampeded, the horses also took fright and 
thousands 
of 
footmen 
were 
trampled 
under the feet of the elephants and the 
horses, flying in wild panic.  
Seeing 
this 
great 
confusion 
and 
the 
scattering of the Kaurava forces in all 
directions, the king of Pragjyotisha, the 
brave Bhagadatta grew indignant.  
He got up on his renowned elephant 
Supratika and charged against Bhimasena. 
The gigantic beast rushed forward with 
widespread 
ears 
and 
twirling 
trunk, 
crashed into Bhimasena's chariot. And in 
an instant, horses and vehicle were an 
unrecognizable mass. But Bhima escaped 
by jumping off the car in the nick of time.  
He knew all about elephants. He got 
below the great and fierce elephant and 
showered blows on its vital points. The 
great beast got mad and whirled round 
like a potter's wheel, trying to throw off 
Bhimasena, who was sticking to its legs 
and attcking it from below.  
It bent down and caught Bhima by its 
trunk and was about to crush him under its 
knees, when Vrikodara somehow released 
himself from its hold and again got below, 
in between its limbs and sticking to the 
elephant's 
under-regions, 
caused 
exceeding pain to the beast. 
Bhima was thus gaining time in the hope 
that some elephant on the Pandava side 
would be led to attack Bhagadatta's 
elephant and enable him to get away.  
But, when Bhima disappeared from view, 
being hidden in between the beast's legs, 
the soldiers thought Bhima was slain. 
They 
exclaimed: 
"Bhima 
is 
dead! 
Bhagadatta's 
elephant 
has 
crushed 
Bhimasena!" and the cry was repeated all 
over Kurukshetra.  
Yudhishthira heard the cry and, thinking 
Bhima was slain, urged the forces to 
destroy Bhagadatta. The king of Dasarna 
charged 
against 
Bhagadatta. 
Dasarna's 
elephant was also a fierce beast and there 
was great battle between Supratika and 
Dasarna's elephant.  
But Supratika's tusk pierced Dasarna's 
beast in the side and it crashed down dead. 
At that moment, Bhima emerged from 
below Supratika and ran out safe. And the 
Pandava army cheered when they saw 
Bhima alive. 
Bhagadatta was now attacked on all sides, 
but he did not lose heart. Resplendent on 
his elephant, he shone like a forest fire on 
a hill. Ignoring the enemies around him, 
he drove his beast on Satyaki's chariot.  
The elephant seized the chariot with its 
great trunk and lifting it high dashed it 
upside down. Satyaki jumped out of the 
chariot in time to save himself.  
His charioteer displayed great agility and 
skill and saved the vehicle as well as the 
horses, and righting the chariot, drove it to 
where Satyaki stood.  
Bhagadatta's 
elephant 
wrought 
great 
havoc 
in 
the 
Pandava 
army, 
hurling 
warriors about and killing them in great 
number, striking terror wherever it went. 
Bhagadatta stood on its back, like Indra 
on Airavata when he fought the asuras.  
With ears spread out rigid in anger and 
trunk extended in front, the great beast 
trampled upon numerous horses, chariots 
and soldiers and wrought destruction all 
over the Pandava army. The shafts hurled 
at it seemed only to incense it more.  
Like a herdsman in the forest driving the 
cattle where he would, Bhagadatta drove 
the soldiers of the Pandava army before 
him. Bhimasena, equipping himself once 
again with a chariot, renewed his attack 
on Bhagadatta.  
The elephant stretched out its trunk and 
blew out a violent spray of mucus that 
scared the horses of Bhima's chariot and 
they 
bolted 
in 
wild 
flight 
and 
the 
charioteer could not check them.  
A great cloud of dust rose from the field 
where this great elephant battle raged. 
Arjuna saw this from where he was 
fighting the samsaptakas and he also 
heard the tumult created by Bhagadatta's 
elephant.  
He feared things had gone wrong and said 
to Krishna: "Madhusudana, this is the cry 
of Supratika, Bhagadatta's elephant. This 
king of Pragjyotisha is terrible with his 
elephant, and has no equal in that kind of 
warfare. He is sure to defeat and confound 
our men. We must proceed at once and 
save the situation. We have punished 
these samsaptakas enough. Drive to where 
Drona is engaging Yudhishthira." Krishna 
drove the chariot accordingly towards the 
main battlefront. 
Susarma and his brothers came up behind 
the chariot and shouted "Stop, stop." At 
the same time, they discharged shafts at 
Arjuna's chariot.  
Arjuna was of two minds.  
"Here is Susarma challenging me to battle 
and 
I 
hated 
declining 
this 
kind 
of 
invitation, but there, to the north of us, our 
formation seems broken and our men are 
in need of immediate relief." 
While Arjuna was pondering thus, a 
javelin 
came 
hurtling 
at 
Arjuna 
and 
another towards Janardana. Wild with 
anger, 
Arjuna 
sent 
three 
well-aimed 
shafts, which compelled Susarma to turn 
back. 
They lost no more time but drove quickly 
to where Bhagadatta was doing havoc. As 
soon as Arjuna's car was seen, the 
Pandava forces rallied and soon Arjuna 
reached the lines where Bhagadatta was.  
Bhagadatta attacked Arjuna on Supratika 
like 
the 
Destroyer 
incarnate. 
But 
Vasudeva's skill avoided the shock, each 
time the beast charged.  
Bhagadatta showered arrows on Arjuna 
and Krishna. But Arjuna's arrows broke 
the elephant's armor and began to hurt the 
beast. Bhagadatta saw that his elephant 
could no longer stand the attack and he 
hurled a javelin at Krishna.  
Arjuna met it with a shaft from his bow 
and broke it into two. Bhagadatta then 
discharged another javelin that struck 
Dhananjaya's helmet. 
Readjusting his helmet, Arjuna bent his 
bow exclaiming: "Bhagadatta, take your 
last look at the world and prepare for 
death!"  
Bhagadatta 
was 
a 
veteran 
of 
very 
advanced age. His grey hair and the 
wrinkles on his noble old face gave him 
the intrepid appearance of a lion. Indeed, 
so old was he that the skin hung loose 
down over his eyes and he had tied its 
folds over his forehead with a silk 
kerchief so that they might not interfere 
with his sight.  
Bhagadatta was not more renowned for 
valor than for purity of character and 
conduct and was one of the most 
illustrious among the brave men of his 
time. Men gave him the title 'Friend of 
Indra' in recognition of his greatness. 
"Look around for the last time," said 
Arjuna to this great man and hurled at him 
shafts that broke his bow, shattered his 
quiver and pierced the joints of his armor. 
In those days, all warriors wore heavy 
armor and the secret of hitting weak 
points such as joints and moving parts was 
specially studied by kshatriyas and was an 
important part of military training.  
When 
deprived 
of 
all 
his 
weapons, 
Bhagadatta hurled his elephant goad at 
Arjuna. It was sent with deadly aim and 
charged with the Vaishnava mantra.  
It would have killed Arjuna, but Krishna 
came in between and presented himself as 
a target for the missile. It settled on his 
chest as a shining necklace.  
Charged with the mantra of Vishnu, it 
could not hurt Vishnu but just became the 
Lord's jewelled garland round his neck.  
"Janardana, how is it you have offered 
yourself as a target for the enemy's 
missile? You said you would be charioteer 
and leave all the fighting to me. How 
could you do this?" protested Arjuna. 
"Beloved Arjuna, you do not understand. 
This shaft would have killed you if it had 
hit you. But it is really my own thing and 
came back to its lawful owner," Krishna 
said and laughed. Then, Partha sent an 
arrow 
that 
entered 
the 
head 
of 
Bhagadatta's elephant as a serpent enters 
into the anthill.  
Bhagadatta tried to urge his great beast 
forward, but it stood stark rigid. And his 
loud command went in vain even as the 
words of man, who has lost his wealth, are 
disregarded by his wife. 
Like a great hill the elephant stood rigid 
for a moment and then it suddenly sank 
down driving its tusks into the earth and 
yielded up the ghost with an agonised 
squeal. 
Arjuna was somewhat grieved at the death 
of the noble animal and for his not having 
been able to slay Bhagadatta, without 
killing the beast.  
Arjuna's shafts tore the silken napkin that 
bound up the folds of the aged king's 
forehead and he was blinded at once by 
his own hanging wrinkles.  
Soon, a sharp crescent-headed shaft came 
and pierced his chest. And Bhagadatta fell 
like a great tree in a storm, his golden 
necklace shining like flowers on the 
uprooted tree. The Kaurava forces fell into 
utter confusion. 
Sakuni's brothers Vrisha and Achala tried 
their best to oppose Arjuna and attacked 
him in front and rear. But their chariots 
were soon dashed to pieces and they were 
themselves stricken dead on the field like 
two lion cubs. They both looked much 
alike and equally noble in appearance. 
The poet says that the bodies of these two 
valiant heroes who did not flee when the 
rest fled, shed a strange lustre all around. 
Sakuni was full of anger when he saw his 
brave and incomparable brothers lying 
dead on the field.  
He attacked Arjuna fiercely and used all 
the weapons of illusion, in which he was 
skilled. But Arjuna's strokes broke all the 
charms and rendered them useless. And 
Sakuni had to leave the field, as fast as his 
horses could bear him. 
The Pandava forces then attacked Drona's 
army and wrought great havoc till the 
sunset, and the twelfth day's fight ended. 
Drona gave orders to cease fighting and 
the 
Kaurava 
forces, 
which 
had 
lost 
heavily, retired in sullen dejection to their 
camp.  
The Pandava army, on the other band, was 
in high spirits and its warriors gathered 
round campfires in cheerful talk and 
praise of Arjuna and the other heroes, who 
had led them to victory.  
79. ABHIMANYU 
EARLY next morning, Duryodhana went 
to Dronacharya in a state of bitterness and 
anger. After the customary salutation, he 
addressed him thus in the presence of a 
large number of generals: 
"Esteemed brahmana, Yudhishthira was 
quite within your reach yesterday and, if 
you had really wished to take him no one 
could have prevented you. Yet, you did 
not take him, and to me the events of 
yesterday 
are 
inexplicable. 
I 
cannot 
understand what makes it hard for you to 
carry out your promise to me. Verily great 
men are not understandable."  
Dronacharya was exceedingly hurt by this 
insulting insinuation. 
"Duryodhana," he said, "I am putting forth 
on your be half all the strength and skill I 
possess. You entertain thoughts unworthy 
of a king. As long as Arjuna is present, 
supporting Yudhishthira, it is not possible 
for us to seize him. I have told you that 
already. It is only if we manage some how 
to get Arjuna out of the battlefield that we 
can hope to carry out this plan as you 
desire. And I am devising ways to attain 
this objective." 
Thus did Drona nobly conquer his just 
anger and seek to comfort Duryodhana in 
his distress.  
On the thirteenth day, the samsaptakas 
again challenged Arjuna to battle and he 
accordingly went to attack them, where 
they were arrayed to the south of the main 
battlefront. The battle that was fought 
between the samsaptakas and Arjuna was 
the fiercest that ever had been seen or 
heard of till that day. 
When Dhananjaya left the main front for 
meeting 
the 
samsaptakas, 
Drona 
rearranged his army in lotus formation 
and attacked Yudhishthira fiercely.  
Bhima, 
Satyaki, 
Chekitana, 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
Kuntibhoja, 
Drupada, 
Ghatotkacha, 
Yudhamanyu, 
Sikhandin, 
Uttamaujas, 
Virata, 
the 
Kekayas, 
Srinjayas and many others opposed him. 
But their resistance seemed paralysed by 
the violence of Drona's offensive.  
Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna and Subhadra, 
was still adolescent, but had already won 
recognition as a mighty man-at arms even 
as the equal of his father and uncle in 
battle. 
Yudhishthira 
called 
Abhimanyu 
and said to him: 
"Dear son, Dronacharya is attacking our 
army greatly. Arjuna is absent and, if we 
should be defeated in his absence, he will 
be grieved beyond measure. No one 
among us has been able to break Drona's 
array. You know you can do it and no one 
else. I ask you to take up this task."  
"I can do it," replied Abhimanyu. "I have 
been instructed by my father how to 
penetrate this formation and can certainly 
do so. But if after forcing my way, it 
should 
unfortunately 
become 
necessary 
for me to come out, I shall be at a loss 
what to do, being as yet uninstructed in 
the art of extrication." 
"Valiant 
boy, 
break 
this 
impregnable 
formation and open a passage for us. We 
shall all break in your wake. We shall be 
with you to face any danger and no 
question can arise of your having to come 
out." 
Bhimasena 
supported 
Yudhishthira's 
proposal: "I shall be immediately behind 
you and enter when you succeed in 
breaking the enemy's formation. So also 
will 
Dhrishtadyumna, 
Satyaki, 
the 
Panchalas, the Kekayas and the forces of 
Matsyadesa. Only break the formation as 
you alone can do. We shall do the rest and 
smash the Kaurava army." 
Abhimanyu thought of his father and 
Krishna. Feeling encouraged by what had 
been 
said 
by 
Bhimasena 
and 
Yudhishthira, and impelled by his own 
gallant nature, undertook the adventure.  
"I shall please my great father and uncle," 
he said with enthusiasm. "Let my valor be 
staked on this."  
"May 
your 
prowess 
grow," 
said 
Yudhishthira and blessed the youth. 
"Sumitra, see Drona's flag flying there! 
Drive straight and fast to that point," said 
Abhimanyu to his charioteer. 
"Faster, faster!" urged Abhimanyu as they 
sped along.  
"May the gods protect you!" said the 
charioteer. "Yudhishthira has placed a 
very 
great 
burden 
on 
your 
young 
shoulders. Think well before you pierce 
Drona's array and enter. The acharya is 
unrivalled in skill and experience, while 
you, though his equal in valor, have not 
his long years to back it." 
Abhimanyu smiled and replied: "Friend, I 
am Krishna's nephew and son of Arjuna, 
am I not? Which other has that advantage? 
Fear dares not approach me! These 
enemies here have not a sixteenth part of 
my strength. Drive fast towards Drona's 
division. Do not hesitate."  
The charioteer obeyed.  
As the golden chariot to which were 
yoked beautiful young horses approached, 
the soldiers in the Kaurava army shouted: 
"Abhimanyu is corning! He has come!" 
The Pandavas followed Abhimanyu close 
behind him.  
The Kaurava warriors were perturbed as 
they saw Abhimanyu's chariot approach 
them with great speed.  
"Here is one greater in valor than Arjuna," 
they thought and began to lose heart.  
Like a young lion on a herd of elephants, 
Abhimanyu rushed on. There was a ripple 
in the Kaurava ranks which bent under his 
headlong onslaught.  
The bend soon became a break and under 
Drona's very eyes, the formation was 
breached and Abhimanyu entered. But the 
breach closed under the inspiration of 
Jayadratha, king of the Sindhus, before 
the other Pandava warriors could force 
their way in according to plan and 
Abhimanyu was alone!  
Kaurava warriors opposed him, but they 
fell like moths in the fire, one after 
another. Abhimanyu's shafts searched the 
weak points in the armor of his enemies. 
And the bodies of soldiers lay strewn on 
the field like Kusa grass on the sacrificial 
platform. 
Bows, arrows, swords, shields, javelins, 
pieces of harness, chaiot canopies, axes, 
maces, spears, whips, conchs, along with 
severed heads and limbs of slain warriors, 
covered the field. 
Seeing 
the 
destruction 
wrought 
by 
Abhimanyu, Duryodhana was wroth and 
rushed in person to oppose the youthful 
warrior. Drona, having leant that the king 
himself 
was 
engaged 
in 
battle 
with 
Abhimanyu, became anxious and sent 
veterans to protect Duryodhana.  
With great difficulty, they managed to 
rescue the king from the boy-hero who 
greatly disappointed at the escape of 
Duryodhana, vented his anger on the 
warriors that had come to rescue him and 
put them to headlong flight. 
Then, throwing away all sense of shame 
and chivalry, a large number of veteran 
warriors 
made 
a 
combined 
and 
simultaneous attack on the hero, who 
found 
himself 
alone, 
surrounded 
by 
enemies on all sides. But, even as on all 
sides a rock receives the rising tide of the 
sea, Arjuna's son withstood this united 
ouslaught.  
Drona, 
Aswatthama, 
Kripa, 
Karna, 
Sakuni, Salya and many other great 
warriors in their chariots, equipped with 
all arms, surged in attack on the young 
hero, only to be dashed back, baffled and 
broken.  
Asmaka rode his chariot at great speed 
against 
Abhimanyu's. 
But 
smiling, 
Abhimanyu sent his shafts and disposed 
of him in no time. Karna's armor was 
pierced.  
Salya was badly wounded and sat, unable 
to move, in his chariot. Salya's brother 
came up in great wrath to avenge his 
brother's disgrace but he fell and his 
chariot was broken to pieces. 
Thus 
did 
Abhimanyu, 
alone 
and 
unsupported, oppose a host of veteran 
warriors and show the skill in the use of 
arms 
which he had learnt from his 
illustrious father and from Vasudeva, his 
uncle. 
Seeing 
this, 
the 
poet 
says, 
Dronacharya's eyes were filled with tears 
of affectionate admiration.  
"Was there ever a fighter to equal this boy 
Abhimanyu?" exclaimed Drona to Kripa, 
in the hearing of Duryodhana who could 
not contain his anger. 
"The 
acharya's 
partiality 
for 
Arjuna 
prevents him from killing Abhimanyu," 
Duryodhana said, "and he sings his praises 
instead of fighting him. Indeed, if the 
acharya were minded to dispose of 
Abhimanyu, would it take him long to do 
it!"  
Often 
did 
Duryodhana 
suspect 
and 
complain in this manner against Bhishma 
and Drona. Having undertaken a war of 
adharma, he was often led to speak in this 
manner and hurt the feelings of the 
acharyas who stood loyally by him, even 
when they saw the wickedness of his 
ways.  
Duhsasana 
roared 
in 
anger 
and 
exclaiming: "This obstinate lad will perish 
now!" led his chariot forward to attack 
Abhimanyu. The chariots of Abhimanyu 
and 
Duhsasana 
made 
wonderful 
movement against each other and the 
battle raged long.  
Duhsasana was struck senseless in his car, 
and his charioteer just managed to drive 
away from the field saving Duhsasana's 
life. Karna attacked Abhimanyu with his 
shafts and harassed him greatly.  
But one of Abhimanyu's arrows felled 
Karna's bow and the young warrior 
followed up this advantage so vigorously 
that he put Karna and his supporters to 
flight. The Kaurava forces, when they saw 
this, were completely demoralised. 
The army was in confusion and men fled 
in all directions, not caring for Drona's 
shouts of remonstrance. And Abhimanyu 
destroyed those that stood, as fire destroys 
a dry jungle in summer. 
80. THE DEATH OF ABHIMANYU 
THE Pandavas, proceeding according to 
plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu 
when 
he 
broke 
into 
the 
Kaurava 
formation. But Dhritarashtra's son-in-law 
Jayadratha, 
the 
gallant 
king 
of 
the 
Sindhus, 
swooped 
down 
upon 
the 
Pandavas with all his forces and enabled 
the 
breach 
in 
the 
formation 
to 
be 
effectively and solidly closed up, so that 
the Pandavas found it impossible to force 
their way in. 
Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut 
Jayadratha's bow. But in an instant, the 
Saindhava took up another bow and sent 
unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.  
Bhimasena's arrows made deadly work, 
crashing down the canopy and flagstaff of 
Jayadratha's car. But the Saindhava, was 
alert and rearmed himself, each time his 
equipment was broken. He killed Bhima's 
chariot horses, and the latter had to go into 
Satyaki's car. 
In this manner, Jayadratha, with stubborn 
valor, 
prevented 
the 
Pandavas 
from 
entering in Abhimanyu's wake. The young 
hero was thus isolated and surrounded by 
the Kaurava forces. 
The son 
of 
Subhadra 
was 
however 
undaunted. He attacked all the warriors 
around him and slew them in great 
number. Like rivers losing themselves in 
the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack 
him, disappeared before his arrows. The 
Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu's 
onslaughts.  
Duryodhana's son Lakshmana, a gallant 
young 
warrior, 
then 
charged 
on 
Abhimanyu. 
When 
they 
saw 
this, 
retreating 
soldiers 
came 
back 
and 
supported Lakshmana, showering arrows 
on Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill.  
Still, Arjuna's son was undaunted and, his 
shaft came swift and shining, like a 
serpent 
fresh-sloughed, 
and 
pierced 
Lakshmana. The handsome youth, with 
beautiful nose and eyebrows and hair, lay 
dead on the field and the Kaurava soldiers 
were filled with grief. 
"To hell with the wicked Abhimanyu," 
shouted Duryodhana, and the six great 
warriors, 
Dorna, 
Kripa, 
Karna, 
Aswatthama, Brihatbala and Kritavarma 
closed upon Abhimanyu.  
"It is impossible to pierce this youth's 
armor," said Drona to Karna. "Aim at the 
reins of his horses and cut them off. 
Disable him thus and attack him from 
behind." 
The 
son 
of 
Surya 
did 
accordingly. 
Abhimanyu's bow was broken by a shaft 
discharged from behind. His horses and 
charioteer were killed. Thus disabled, the 
young warrior stood on the field, with 
sword and shield, facing his enemies.  
As he stood dauntless like kshatriya 
dharma incarnate, he filled the warriors 
around 
with 
amazement. 
Whirling 
his 
sword, he held his own against the 
numerous warriors who had surrounded 
him, with a skill that confounded them.  
It seemed to them as if his feet did not rest 
on earth and he was on wings, in the air. 
Drona sent a shaft that broke Abhimanyu's 
sword. Karna's sharp arrows tore his 
shield into bits. 
Then Abhimanyu bent down and taking 
up one of his chariot wheels and whirling 
it like a discus, stood up facing all the 
enemies that surrounded him.  
The dust from the chariot wheel covered 
him and the poet says it enhanced the 
natural beauty of the young hero. He 
fought fiercely like a second Vishnu with 
the discus.  
But soon, the combined onslaught of the 
warriors 
that 
surrounded 
him 
overpowered him. The chariot wheel was 
shattered to pieces. The son of Duhsasana 
came up then and closed with him in 
mortal combat.  
Both went down together but Duhsasana's 
son rose again and, while Abhimanyu was 
struggling to his feet, struck him with his 
mace and killed him. 
"Subhadra's son who, like an elephant in a 
lily pond, single-handed worked havoc in 
the Kaurava army, was thus overpowered 
by numbers and killed cruelly," said 
Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.  
"And, having killed him, your people 
danced around his dead body like savage 
hunters exulting over their prey. All good 
men in the army were grieved and tears 
rolled from their eyes. Even the birds of 
prey, that circled overhead making noises 
seemed to cry 'Not thus!' 'Not thus!' "  
While there was blowing of conchs and 
cries of victory all over the Kaurava army, 
Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, did not 
approve of all this. "This is ignoble," he 
angrily cried. 
"Soldiers, you have forgotten your code. 
Verily, you should be ashamed but, 
instead, you shout brazen cries of victory. 
Having committed a most wicked deed, 
you revel in foolish joy, blind to the 
danger that is imminent."  
So saying, Yuyutsu threw his weapon 
away in disgust and left the battlefield. 
This young son of Dhritarashtra feared 
sin. His words were not sweet in the 
Kaurava ears, but he was a good man and 
spoke out his mind.  
81. A FATHER'S GRIEF 
YUDHISHTHIRA 
was 
plunged 
in 
sorrow. "He has gone to the sleep that 
knows no waking, he who in battle 
overcame 
Drona, 
Aswatthama 
and 
Duryodhana 
and 
who 
was 
like 
a 
destroying fire to enemy forces. O warrior 
that made Duhsasana flee in fear, are you 
dead? What then is there for me to fight 
for or win? Why do we want kingdom 
now? What words of comfort can I offer 
to Arjuna? And what shall I say to 
Subhadra, quivering like a cow bereaved 
of her calf? How can I utter to them vain 
words of solace that serve no purpose? 
Truly, 
ambition 
destroys 
the 
understanding of men. Like the fool who, 
looking for honey, falls into a precipitous 
pit below and is destroyed, in my desire 
for victory I pushed to the battlefront this 
boy, whose life was all before him in love 
and joy. There is no fool like me in the 
world. I have killed Arjuna's beloved son, 
instead of protecting him during 
the 
absence of his father." 
Thus 
was 
Yudhishthira 
lamenting 
in 
histent. Around him were sitting warriors, 
silent in sorrowful thought of the valor of 
the youthful hero and his cruel death. It 
was always the custom with Vyasa to 
come 
and 
comfort 
the 
Pandavas, 
whenever they were in great sorrow.  
He was their great teacher as well as 
grandsire. So he appeared now before 
Yudhishthira. The sage was received with 
all honor and Yudhishthira, having made 
him sit, said: "I have tried very hard to 
find peace of mind, but I am unable to 
find it." 
"You are wise and a knower," said Vyasa, 
"and it is not meet that you should allow 
yourself to be lost in grief in this manner. 
Knowing the nature of death, it is not right 
that you should grieve like the unlearned."  
Vyasa proceeded to console the bereaved 
Dharmaputra: 
"When 
Brahma 
created 
living beings, he was filled with anxiety. 
These lives will multiply and soon their 
number will be beyond the capacity of the 
earth to bear. There seems to be no way of 
coping with this. This thought of Brahma 
grew into a flame which became bigger 
and bigger until it threatened to destroy all 
creation at once. Then Rudra came and 
pleaded for allaying this destructive fire. 
Brahma controlled the great fire and 
subdued it into the law that is known to 
mortals as Death. This law of the creator 
takes many forms, such as war or sickness 
or accident and keeps the balance between 
birth 
and 
death. 
Death 
is 
thus 
an 
inescapable law of existence, ordained for 
the good of the world. It is not true 
wisdom to be impatient with Death or to 
grieve immoderately for those who die. 
There is no reason to pity those who pass 
away. We may have reason indeed to 
grieve for those who remain." After 
saying these words of solace, Krishna 
Dwaipayana retired. 
Dhananjaya and Krishna were proceeding 
towards their camp after defeating and 
slaying the samsaptakas. 
"Govinda, I do not know why," said 
Arjuna, "but my mind is not at ease. My 
mouth feels parched and my heart is 
troubled with a great foreboding of loss. I 
wonder if any calamity has happened to 
Yudhishthira. 
Something 
makes 
me 
afraid, Krishna." 
"Do 
not 
be 
concerned 
about 
Yudhishthira," 
replied 
Krishna."He 
and 
your other brothers are safe." On the way, 
they halted and did the evening prayers. 
Remounting the chariot, they proceeded to 
the camp. As they approached the camp, 
Arjuna's 
premonitions 
of 
calamity 
increased.  
"Janardana, we do not hear the usual 
auspicious 
music 
in 
the 
camp. 
The 
soldiers, seeing me from a distance, hang 
down their heads and avoid my sight. This 
is strange behavior on their part. O 
Madhava, I fear greatly. Do you think my 
brothers are safe? I am confused. How is 
it Abhimanyu does not run out to meet us 
today as usual, accompanied by his 
brothers?" 
They entered the camp.  
"Why are you all wearing sad faces? I do 
not see Abhimanyu here. How is it I see 
no glad faces? I understood that Drona 
arrayed his army in the lotus formation. 
No one among you could pierce it as far 
as I know. Did Abhimanyu force his way 
in? If so, he is dead, for I did not teach 
him how to make his way out of that 
formation. Has he been slain indeed?" 
When 
their 
mournful 
silence, 
and 
downcast eyes, that dared not meet his, 
had 
confirmed 
his 
worst 
fears, 
the 
bereaved father burst into heart-broken 
lamentation. 
"Alas, has my dear boy indeed become 
Yama's guest? Yudhishthira, Bhimasena, 
Dhrishtadyumna and great Satyaki have 
all of you allowed the son of Subhadra to 
be slain by the enemy? Alas! What 
comfort shall I give to Subhadra? What 
shall. I say to Draupadi? And what solace 
can be given to Uttara and who shall give 
it?" 
Vasudeva spoke to his stricken friend. 
"Beloved Arjuna," he said, "do not give 
way thus to grief. Born as kshatriyas we 
have to live and die by weapons. Death is 
ever the companion of those who have 
taken up the profession of arms and go 
into battle, determined not to retreat. 
Warriors must be ever ready to die young. 
Abhimanyu, boy as he was, has attained 
the happy regions above which grey 
haired veterans yearn to reach in battle. 
Abhimanyu's end is indeed the prescribed 
and much desired goal of all kshatriyas. If 
you give way to grief in this inordinate 
way, your brothers and other kings will 
lose 
heart. 
Stop 
grieving 
and 
infuse 
courage and fortitude into the hearts of the 
others," 
Dhananjaya desired to be told the full 
story 
of 
his 
brave 
son's 
end 
and 
Yudhishthira 
related 
it: 
"I 
incited 
Abhimanyu 
to 
enter 
the 
enemy's 
formation. For I knew that he alone could 
do it among all of us. 'Make your way into 
the lotus array and we shall follow 
immediately behind you. This great deed 
of yours will please the hearts of your 
father and your uncle,' I said. The youthful 
hero did accordingly and broke the great 
formation and made his way in. We went 
behind him according to plan. But, just 
then, the wicked Jayadratha came and 
effectively stopped us. He caused the 
breach in the formation to be closed up at 
once and we found ourselves unable to 
follow Abhimanyu. The Sindhu kept us 
out, and then, Oh, shame on kshatriyas 
who 
could 
do 
this! 
A 
crowd 
of 
redoubtable warriors hemmed him in, thus 
isolated, and slew him." 
When he heard the full story, Arjuna was 
again over whelmed by grief and he fell 
on the ground in a swoon. 
When he recovered, he took an oath: 
"Before sunset tomorrow, I shall slay this 
Jayadratha who caused my son's death. If 
Drona and Kripa come between him and 
me 
these 
acharyas 
also 
shall 
be 
overwhelmed and slain!"  
Saying this, he twanged the Gandiva 
string, and Krishna blew the Panchajanya. 
And Bhima said:  
"This twang of Arjuna's bow and this 
blare of Krishna's conch shall be, unto the 
sons of Dhritarashtra, the summons of 
Death!" 
82. THE SINDHU KING 
NEWS of Arjuna's oath reached the 
enemy. The spies informed Duryodhana's 
friends that Arjuna, having learnt that 
Jayadratha was the cause of Abhimanyu's 
death, had vowed to kill the Sindhu king 
before sunset next day.  
Vriddhakshatra, the illustrious king of the 
Sindhus, was blessed with a son, who was 
named Jayadratha. At the time of the birth 
of the prince, a voice was heard to say: 
"This prince will attain great glory and he 
will attain the happy regions above, slain 
in battle. One who, among the warriors of 
all ages, ranks among the most illustrious 
will, in the field of battle, sever his head 
from the body." 
All living beings must die but hardly any, 
however wise or brave, welcome it. 
Vriddhakshatra was grieved to hear the 
voice declare his son's end.  
In his disturbed state of mind, he uttered a 
curse: "He, who shall cause my son's head 
to roll down on the ground, shall have his 
head burst at that very moment into 
fragments." 
Jayadratha grew up and, when he reached 
manhood, Vriddhakshatra handed over the 
care of the State to the prince. He retired 
to the forest, where he spent the evening 
of his days in austerities in an ashrama 
near the plain, which afterwards became 
the Kurukshetra field of battle.  
When Jayadratha came to know about 
Arjuna's 
vow, 
he 
remembered 
the 
prediction about his death and feared his 
end was near.  
"I do not want to be in this battle any 
longer. Let me go back to my country," he 
said to Duryodhana. 
"Do 
not 
fear, 
Saindhava," 
replied 
Duryodhana. "Here are all these veterans 
and warriors who will stand between you 
and danger. Karna, Chitrasena, Vivimsati, 
Bhurisravas, 
Salya, 
Vrishasena, 
Purumitra, 
Jaya, 
Bhoja, 
Kamboja, 
Sudakshina, 
Satyavrata, 
Vikarna, 
Durmukha, Duhsasana, Subahu, Kalinga, 
the 
Avanti 
princes, 
Drona, 
Drona's 
illustrious 
son 
and 
Sakuni 
all 
these 
warriors and I myself are here and you 
cannot be in danger. The whole of my 
army will have but one task today, to 
defend you against Arjuna. You should 
not leave us now." Jayadratha agreed to 
remain. He went to Drona and said to him: 
"Master, you taught me and Arjuna and 
you know us both well. What is your 
appraisal of us two?" 
"Son, I discharged my duties as teacher 
and dealt with you both impartially. The 
instruction was the same to you and to 
Arjuna, but Arjuna excels because of his 
superior discipline and his own practice. 
But, you need not be discouraged by this. 
You will be placed behind a strong force 
that Arjuna cannot easily pierce. Fight 
according 
to 
the 
tradition 
of 
your 
ancestors. Death comes to us all, cowards 
as well as brave men. And the warrior 
dying in battle attains with ease the happy 
regions which others only attain with 
great difficulty. Discard fear and fight."  
Drona, having spoken thus to Jayadratha, 
proceeded to marshal the forces for the 
next day. Twelve miles to the rear of the 
main army Jayadratha and his detachment 
were 
placed 
in 
a 
strongly 
guarded 
position.  
Bhurisravas, Karna, Aswatthama, Salya, 
Vrishasena and Kripa were there with all 
their 
forces. 
Between 
them 
and 
the 
Pandava army, Dronacharya arrayed the 
main 
Kaurava 
forces 
in 
circular 
formation.  
Durmarshana's army was beaten. Like 
clouds driven about by a gale, the 
Kaurava forces were scattered and fled in 
all directions. When Duhsasana saw this, 
his anger rose.  
Leading a huge force of elephants he 
surrounded Arjuna. Duhsasana was a very 
wicked man but he was brave also. He 
fought Arjuna fiercely and the field was 
strewn 
with 
the 
dead. 
Finally, 
he 
withdrew defeated and went back to join 
Drona's forces. 
Savyasachi's 
car 
swiftly 
proceeded 
forward and passed Drona. "Illustrious 
one, grieving for my son, I have come to 
wreak vengeance on the Sindhu king. I 
crave your blessings for the fulfilment of 
my vow," said Arjuna to the acharya.  
The acharya smiled and said: "Arjuna, you 
must first fight and defeat me before you 
can reach Jayadratha." Saying this Drona 
discharged a shower of arrows on Arjuna's 
car. Partha also replied with his arrows 
but these the acharya parried with ease 
and sent flaming shafts that hit Krishna 
and Arjuna.  
The Pandava then decided to cut Drona's 
bow and bent his Gandiva for that 
purpose. Even as he was pulling his 
bowstring Drona's shaft came and cut the 
string.  
The acharya, still retaining the smile on 
his face, rained a shower of arrows on 
Arjuna and his horses and chariot. Arjuna 
fought back, but the acharya showered his 
arrows that covered Arjuna and his chariot 
in darkness. 
Krishna saw things were not going at all 
well and said: "Partha, no more waste of 
time. Let us proceed. It is no use fighting 
this brahmana, who seems to know no 
fatigue." 
Saying 
this, 
Krishna 
drove 
Arjuna's chariot to the left of the acharya 
and proceeded forward. 
"Stop, surely you will not proceed without 
defeating your enemy," said Drona. 
"You are my guru, not my enemy, O 
acharya. I am in the position of a son to 
you. There is no one in the wide world 
that can defeat you," said Arjuna and they 
proceeded 
forward 
at 
a 
swift 
pace 
bypassing Drona. 
Then Arjuna pierced the Bhoja army. 
Kritavarma and Sudakshina who opposed 
his passage were defeated. Srutayudha 
also tried to stop Arjuna's progress. There 
was a fierce battle in which Srutayudha 
lost his horses and he hurled his mace at 
Krishna. 
His mother had obtained this mace as a 
result of her offering but the condition 
attached to the boon operated and it came 
back and struck Srutayudha himself dead. 
This is the story of the mace. 
Parnasa 
went 
through 
penances 
that 
pleased Varuna and obtained from that 
god a boon that her son Srutayudha may 
not be killed by any enemy. 
"I shall give your son a divine weapon. 
Let him use it in all his battles. No enemy 
will be able to defeat him or kill him. But 
he should not use the weapon against one 
who does not fight. If he does, the weapon 
will recoil and kill him. Saying this, god 
Varuna gave a mace. Srutayudha, when 
fighting 
Arjuna, 
disregarding 
the 
injunction, hurled the mace at Krishna 
who was not fighting but was only driving 
Arjuna's chariot.  
The missile hit Janardana's chest and 
immediately rebounded fiercely back to 
Srutayudha. And like a demon recoiling 
fatally on the magician, that commits an 
error in uttering the spell of power that 
holds it in thrall, it slew Srutayudha and 
laid him dead on the field, like a great 
forest tree blown down by a storm. 
Then the king of Kamboja led his forces 
against Arjuna. After a fierce fight, he lay 
stretched dead on the field like a great 
flagstaff after the festival is over. 
When they saw the strong warriors, 
Srutayudha and the king of Kamboja, 
slain, the Kaurava force was in great 
confusion.  
Srutayu and his brother Asrutayu then 
attacked Partha on both sides trying to 
save the situation, and greatly harassed 
him. At one stage of this battle, Arjuna 
leaned on the flagstaff, dazed with the 
wounds he received.  
But Krishna spoke to him encouragingly 
and Arjuna recovered and resumed the 
fight, slaying the two brothers as well as 
their two sons who continued the struggle. 
Arjuna marched on and, killing many 
more warriors successfully made his way 
to Jayadratha. 
83. BORROWED ARMOR 
WHEN Dhritarashtra heard Sanjaya relate 
the success of Arjuna, he exclaimed: "Oh 
Sanjaya! 
When 
Janardana 
came 
to 
Hastinapura seeking a settlement, I told 
Duryodhana 
that 
it 
was 
a 
great 
opportunity and he must not lose it. I told 
him to make peace with his cousins. 
'Kesava has come to do us a good turn. Do 
not disregard his advice,' I said. But 
Duryodhana heeded not. What Karna and 
Duhsasana said seemed to him better 
advice than mine. The Destroyer entered 
his mind and he sought his own ruin. 
Drona 
deprecated war, so also 
did 
Bhishma, Bhurisravas, Kripa and others. 
But my obstinate son would not listen. 
Impelled by inordinate ambition, he got 
entangled in anger and hatred, and invited 
this ruinous war." 
To Dhritarashtra thus lamenting, Sanjaya 
said: "Of what avail are your regrets now? 
The life-giving water has all run to waste 
and you now seek to stop the breach. Why 
did you not prevent the son of Kunti from 
gambling? Had you done the right thing 
then, all this great grief would have been 
stopped at the source. Even later, if you 
had been firm and stopped your son from 
his evil ways, this calamity could have 
been avoided. You saw the evil and yet, 
against your own sound judgment, you 
followed the foolish advice of Karna and 
Sakuni. Kesava, Yudhishthira and Drona 
do not respect you now as they did before. 
Vasudeva now knows that your rectitude 
is only hypocrisy. The Kauravas are now 
doing their utmost as warriors, but they 
are unequal to opposing the strength of 
Arjuna, 
Krishna, 
Satyaki 
and 
Bhima. 
Duryodhana has not spared himself. He is 
putting forth his utmost strength. It is not 
meet that you should now accuse him or 
his devoted soldiers." 
"Dear Sanjaya, I admit my dereliction of 
duty. What you say is right. No one can 
change the course of fate. Tell me what 
happened. Tell me all, be it ever so 
unpleasant," said the old king convulsed 
with grief. And obedient to the old king's 
behest, Sanjaya continued his narration.  
Duryodhana was greatly agitated when he 
saw 
Arjuna's 
chariot 
proceeding 
triumphantly towards the Sindhu king. He 
rushed to Drona and complained bitterly: 
"Arjuna has effected a breach in the great 
army and has advanced to Jayadratha's 
position. 
Seeing 
our 
discomfiture, 
the 
warriors, protecting the Sindhu king, will 
surely lose heart. They had believed that it 
was impossible for Arjuna to get past you 
and that has now been falsified. He 
advanced before your eyes and nothing 
was done to prevent it. You seem indeed 
bent on helping the Pandavas. I am in 
great distress of mind. Sir, tell me, in what 
matter have I offended you? Why are you 
letting me down in this way? If I had 
known that you would do this, I should 
not have asked Jayadratha to stay here. It 
was a great mistake I committed in not 
letting him go, as he desired, back to his 
own country. If Arjuna attacks him, it is 
not possible for him to escape death. 
Forgive 
me. 
I 
am 
talking 
foolishly, 
distracted by grief. Do go in person 
yourself to save the Saindhava."  
To this frantic appeal Drona made answer: 
"King, I shall not take offence at your 
thoughtless and unworthy remarks. You 
are like a son to me. Aswatthama himself 
is not dearer! Do what I ask you. Take this 
coat of armor and, donning it, go and stop 
Arjuna. I cannot do so for my presence is 
necessary in this part of the field. See 
there, the clouds of arrows! The Pandava 
army is attacking us in great force. 
Yudhishthira 
is 
here 
unsupported 
by 
Arjuna and is this not just the opportunity 
we wanted? Our very plan has borne fruit 
and 
I 
must 
now 
take 
Yudhishthira 
prisoner and deliver him to you. I cannot 
give up this objective and run after 
Phalguna now. If I go after Arjuna now, 
our battle array will be hopelessly broken 
and we shall be lost. Let me put this armor 
on you. Go in confidence. Do not fear. 
You have valor, skill and experience. This 
coat will protect you against all weapons. 
It will not let any blow pass through your 
body. Go forth to battle, Duryodhana, in 
confidence as Indra did, clad in the armor 
given by Brahma. May victory be yours." 
Duryodhana's 
confidence 
was 
restored 
and, as the acharya directed, he went, 
dressed in magic armor and accompanied 
by a large force of soldiers, to attack 
Arjuna.  
Arjuna had crossed the Kaurava army and 
gone far ahead towards where Jayadratha 
had been kept for safety. Seeing that the 
horses were somewhat fatigued, Krishna 
stopped the chariot and was about to 
unyoke 
the 
tired 
animals, 
when 
the 
brothers Vinda and Anuvinda came up 
suddenly and began to attack Arjuna.  
They were defeated and Arjuna scattered 
their forces and slew them both. After 
this, Krishna unyoked the chariot and let 
the horses roll in the mud. The horses 
rested for a while and were refreshed. 
Then, they proceeded again according to 
plan. 
"Dhananjaya, look behind! There comes 
the foolhardy Duryodhana. What good 
luck! Long have you suppressed your 
anger, and now is the time for you to let 
yourself go. Here is the man who caused 
all this grief, delivering himself into your 
hands. But remember he is a great archer, 
well-versed in bow lore, and also a keen 
and 
strong-limbed 
fighter." 
Thus 
said 
Krishna and they halted to give battle to 
the Kaurava. 
Duryodhana approached without fear.  
"They say, Arjuna, that you have done 
acts of prowess. I have not seen this 
myself. Let me see if your courage and 
your skill are indeed as great as your 
reputation," said Duryodhana to Arjuna as 
he began to battle. 
The 
combat 
was 
fierce 
indeed 
and 
Krishna was surprised.  
"Partha, I am astonished," said Krishna, 
"How is it your arrows do not seem to 
hurt Duryodhana? This is the first time I 
see 
the 
shafts 
proceeding 
from 
the 
Gandiva bow strike their targets without 
effect. This is strange, Have your arms 
lost their power? Or has the Gandiva bow 
lost its quality? Why do your arrows strike 
Duryodhana and drop to the ground 
without 
piercing 
him? 
This 
is 
most 
puzzling."  
Arjuna smiled and replied: "I understand. 
This man has come dressed by Drona in 
charmed armor. The acharya has taught 
me the secret of this armor, but this man 
wears it as a bullock might do. You will 
see some fun now!"  
Saying thus, Arjuna proceeded to shoot 
his arrows, first depriving Duryodhana of 
his horses, his charioteer and his car. 
Then, Arjuna broke his bow and disarmed 
him 
completely. 
There 
after 
he 
sent 
needle-eye darts which pierced just those 
parts of Duryodhana's body that were not 
covered by armor, until he could bear it no 
longer and turned and fled. 
When Duryodhana was thus discomfited, 
Krishna blew his conch and it sent a thrill 
of fear in Jayadratha's army. The warriors 
around the Sindhu king were surprised. 
They at once got ready in their chariots 
and 
Bhurisravas, 
Chala, 
Karna, 
Vrishasena, 
Kripa, 
Salya, 
Aswatthama 
and Jayadratha, eight of them, arrayed 
their forces against Arjuna.  
84. YUDHISHTHIRA'S MISGIVINGS 
WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana 
proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they 
attacked the Kaurava army in force so as 
to hold Drona and prevent him from going 
to Jayadratha's rescue.  
So, 
Dhrishtadyumna 
led 
his 
forces 
repeatedly against Drona. As a result of 
all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on 
three fronts, and was greatly weakened. 
Driving his chariot right against Drona's, 
Dhrishtadyumna 
attacked 
him 
violently. 
Drona's chestnut horses and the Panchala's 
dove-colored ones were entangled with 
one another and presented a picturesque 
sight like the clouds at sunset.  
Dhrishtadyumna threw away his bow and, 
sword and shield in hand, he sprang upon 
Drona's chariot. Now standing on the 
shafts of the vehicle, now on the horses 
and now on the yoke, he attacked Drona 
bewilderingly, all the while seeming to 
scorch him with baleful and bloodshot 
eyes.  
Long did this fight go on. Drona pulled 
his bow in great wrath and sent a shaft, 
which would have drunk the Panchala's 
life but for the unexpected intervention of 
Satyaki who sent an arrow and diverted 
the acharya's shaft.  
Drona then turned and attacked Satyaki, 
which enabled the Panchala warriors to 
take 
Dhrishtadyumna 
away. 
Drona, 
hissing like a black cobra, his eyes red 
with anger, advanced on Satyaki who was 
among the front rank warriors on the 
Pandava side and who, when he saw 
Drona desiring battle, went forward to 
accept the challenge.  
"Here is the man who, giving up his 
vocation as a brahmana has taken up the 
profession of fighting and is causing 
distress to the Pandavas," Satyaki said to 
his charioteer. "This man is the principal 
cause of Duryodhana's arrogance. This 
man fancies himself a very great soldier 
and is ever bursting with conceit. I must 
teach him a lesson. Take the chariot up 
quickly." 
Satyaki's charioteer accordingly lashed the 
silver-white horses and took the car at a 
great pace. Satyaki and Drona shot shafts 
at one another so quick that they covered 
the sun, and the battlefield was in 
darkness for a while. The steel shafts 
swished glimmering like newly-sloughed 
snakes rushing about. 
The chariot hoods and the flagstaffs on 
both sides were battered down. Drona as 
well as Satyaki were bleeding profusely. 
The warriors on either side stood still 
watching the duel and they did not blow 
their conchs or raise their war cries or 
sound their lion-roars.  
The Devas, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas and 
Yakshas watched the great battle from 
above. Drona's bow was broken by a well-
aimed shaft from Satyaki, and the son of 
Bharadwaja had to take another bow and, 
even as he strung it, Satyaki shot it down 
again. Drona took up another bow  that 
too was shot down.  
And so it went on till Drona lost a 
hundred and one bows without being able 
to shoot an arrow. The great acharya said 
to himself: "This man Satyaki is a warrior 
in the class of Sri Rama, Kartavirya, 
Dhananjaya and Bhishma,"and was glad 
he had an opponent worthy of him.  
It was a craftsman's professional joy at 
skill displayed in the art he loved. For 
every specially-charged shaft that Drona 
sent, Satyaki had a ready answer of 
equivalent quality. Long did this equal 
combat continue. Drona of unrivalled skill 
in archery then resolved on killing Satyaki 
and sent the fire astra. But Satyaki saw 
this and, losing no time, sent the Varuna 
astra to counteract it. 
But now Satyaki's strength began to fail 
and, seeing this, the Kaurava warriors 
were glad and shouted in satisfaction. 
When Yudhishthira saw Satyaki was hard 
pressed, he told those nearby to go to 
Satyaki's relief. "Our great and good hero 
Yuyudhana 
(Satyaki) 
is 
being 
overpowered by Drona. You should go 
there at once," he said to Dhrishtadyumna.  
"The 
brahmana 
will 
otherwise 
slay 
Satyaki in a few minutes. Why are you 
hesitating? Go at once. Drona is playing 
with Satyaki as a cat plays with a bird. 
Satyaki is indeed in the paws of the 
Destroyer." 
Yudhishthira 
ordered 
the 
army to make a powerful attack on Drona. 
Satyaki was saved with difficulty. Just 
then, the sound of Krishna's conch was 
heard from the sector where Arjuna was 
fighting. 
"O Satyaki, I hear Panchajanya," cried 
Yudhishthira; "but the twang of Arjuna's 
bow does not accompany it. I fear Arjuna 
has 
been 
surrounded 
by 
Jayadratha's 
friends 
and 
is in danger. Arjuna is 
opposed by forces both in front of him 
and in his rear. He pierced the Kaurava 
ranks in the morning and he has not come 
back yet though the greater part of the day 
is gone. How is it that only Krishna's 
conch is heard? I fear Dhananjaya has 
been slain and therefore Krishna has taken 
up arms. Satyaki, there is nothing you 
cannot accomplish. Your bosom friend 
Arjuna, he, who taught you, is in mortal 
danger. Often has Arjuna spoken to me 
admiringly 
of 
your 
great 
skill 
and 
prowess. 'There is not another soldier like 
Satyaki,' he said to me when we were in 
the forest. Oh, look there! The dust is 
rising that side. I am certain Arjuna has 
been surrounded. Jayadratha is a powerful 
warrior, 
and 
there 
are 
many 
enemy 
warriors there helping him and resolved to 
die in defence of him. Go at once, 
Satyaki." Thus did Dharmaputra speak in 
great trepidation. 
Satyaki, who was weary after his battle 
with Drona, replied: "Faultless among 
men, I shall obey your command. What 
would I not do for Dhananjaya's sake? My 
life is the merest trifle in my eyes. If you 
order me, I am ready to fight the gods 
themselves. But allow me to put before 
you what the wise Vasudeva and Arjuna 
told me when they left. 'Until we return 
after slaying Jayadratha you should not 
leave Yudhishthira's side. Be vigilant in 
protecting him. We entrust this to you in 
confidence and go. There is only one 
warrior in the Kaurava army whom we 
fear, and he is Drona. You know his 
sworn 
intention. 
We 
go 
leaving 
Dharmaputra's safety in our hands.' Thus 
said Vasudeva and Arjuna to me when 
they went. Arjuna laid this trust on me, 
believing me fit for it. How can I 
disregard his command? Do not have any 
fear about Arjuna's safety. No one can 
defeat him. The Sindhu king and the 
others cannot cope with a sixteenth part of 
Arjuna. Dharmaputra, to whom shall I 
entrust your safety if I must go? I see no 
one here who can stand against Drona if 
he comes to seize you. Do not ask me to 
go. Consider well before you command 
me to leave."  
"Satyaki," replied Yudhishthira, "I have 
thought over it. As I have weighed the 
danger against the need and I have 
concluded that you must go. You leave 
me with my full permission. Here is the 
powerful Bhima to look to my safety. 
There is Dhrishtadyumna also, and there 
are many others besides. There is no need 
to worry about me." 
So saying, Yudhishthira placed a boxful 
of arrows and other weapons in Satyaki's 
chariot and got fresh horses yoked thereto 
and sent Satyaki uttering benedictions on 
him.  
"Bhimasena, Yudhishthira is your charge. 
Be vigilant," said Satyaki, and went to 
join Dhananjaya. 
Satyaki met with violent resistance as he 
proceeded to dash through the Kaurava 
forces. But he cut his way through bearing 
down all opposition. But the resistance 
was very stiff and his progress was slow.  
When Drona saw Satyaki part from 
Yudhishthira, he began to assault the 
Pandava 
formation 
without 
rest 
or 
interval, until it began to break and retreat. 
Yudhishthira was greatly agitated. 
85. YUDHISHTHIRA'S FOND HOPE 
"ARJUNA has not returned, nor has 
Satyaki, who was sent after him. Bhima, 
my fear grows. I hear the Panchajanya, 
but not the twang of Arjuna's bowstring. 
Satyaki, that bravest and most loyal of 
friends, has not come back with any 
tidings. My anxiety is increasing every 
moment," said Yudhishthira to Bhima in 
great perplexity of mind. 
"I have never seen you so agitated," 
replied Bhimasena. "Do, not let your 
fortitude grow less. Command me as you 
please. Do not let the wheels of your mind 
stick in the mud of anxiety." 
"Dearest Bhima, I fear your brother has 
been slain, and it seems to me Madhava 
has now himself taken up arms. I hear the 
conch of Madhava but I hear not the 
resounding twang of Gandiva. I fear 
Dhananjaya, the unrivalled hero, in whom 
were centerd all our hopes, has been 
killed. My mind is confused. If you would 
do as I tell you, go at once to where 
Arjuna is. Join him and Satyaki, and do 
what needs to be done, and come back. 
Satyaki, under orders from me, pierced 
the Kaurava ranks and proceeded in the 
direction of Arjuna. You go now, and do 
likewise and, if you indeed see them alive, 
I shall know it by your lion-roar."  
"My Lord, do not grieve. I shall go and let 
you know they are safe," said Bhima, and 
immediately 
turning 
to 
Dhrishtadyumna 
said: "Panchala, you know very well that 
Drona is seeking, by some means or other, 
to seize Dharmaputra alive. Our foremost 
duty is to protect the King. But I must also 
obey him and fulfil his command. And so 
I go, trusting him to your care." 
"Bhima, do not be concerned. Go with an 
assured 
mind. 
Drona 
cannot 
take 
Yudhishthira 
without 
first 
killing 
me," 
said the heroic son of Drupada, sworn 
enemy of Drona. And Bhima hurried 
away. 
The Kauravas surrounded Bhima in full 
force and vowed to prevent him from 
going to Arjuna's relief. But like a lion 
scattering less noble beasts he put his 
enemies to flight, killing no less than 
eleven of the sons of Dhritarashtra. Bhima 
then approached Drona himself. "Stop," 
cried Drona. "Here I am, your enemy. 
You 
cannot 
proceed 
further 
without 
defeating me. Your brother Arjuna went 
in with my consent. But I cannot let you 
go." Drona spoke thus believing that he 
would receive the same courtesy from 
Bhima as he did from Arjuna. But Bhima 
was furious at hearing these words of 
Drona, and answered scornfully. 
"Oh brahmana, it was not with your 
permission that Arjuna went. He broke 
your resistance and pierced your battle 
lines fighting his way through, but he did 
not hurt you out of pity. But I shall not, 
like Arjuna, show mercy to you. I am your 
enemy. Once upon a time, you were our 
preceptor and were like a father to us. We 
respected you as such. Now, you have 
yourself said you are our enemy. May it 
be so!" Saying this, Bhima aimed his 
mace at Drona's chariot that crumbled to 
pieces. And Drona had to take to another 
chariot.  
The second chariot too was broken to 
pieces. 
And 
Bhima 
forced 
his 
way 
through overcoming all opposition. Drona 
lost eight chariots that day. And the army 
of the Bhojas, that tried to stop Bhima, 
was completely destroyed.  
He 
proceeded 
mowing 
down 
all 
opposition and reached where Arjuna was 
fighting Jayadratha's forces. 
As soon as he saw Arjuna, Bhima roared 
like a lion. Hearing that roar, Krishna and 
Arjuna were exceedingly pleased and 
raised yells of joy. Yudhishthira heard 
these roars and, relieved of his doubts and 
anxieties, he pronounced blessings on 
Arjuna. And he thought within himself:  
"Before the sun sets today, Arjuna's oath 
will be fulfilled. He will slay the man who 
caused Abhimanyu's death and will return 
in triumph. Duryodhana may sue for 
peace after Jayadratha's death. Seeing so 
many of his brothers slain, it is possible 
that foolish Duryodhana may see light. 
The lives of numerous kings and great 
warriors have been sacrificed on the field 
of battle and even the stubborn and 
narrow-visioned 
Duryodhana 
may 
now 
see his fault and ask for peace. Will this 
indeed 
happen? 
The 
great 
grandsire 
Bhishma has been offered as a sacrifice. 
Will this wicked enmity end with it and 
shall we be saved from further cruel 
destruction?"  
While 
thus 
Yudhishthira 
was 
fondly 
hoping and dreaming of peace, the battle 
was raging with great fury where Bhima, 
Satyaki and Arjuna were engaging the 
enemy.  
Only the Lord knows through what travail 
the world must evolve. His ways are 
inscrutable.  
86. KARNA AND BHIMA 
ARJUNA had left Yudhishthira behind to 
repel Drona's attacks and had gone to 
make good his word that before sunset 
Jayadratha would lie dead on the field of 
battle.  
Jayadratha had been the main cause of 
Abhimanyu's death. He it was who had 
effectively 
prevented 
the 
relief 
of 
Abhimanyu by the Pandavas, and thereby 
caused 
Abhimanyu 
to 
be 
isolated, 
overpowered and slain. 
We have seen how Yudhishthira in his 
anxiety sent first Satyaki and then Bhima 
to join Arjuna in his battle against 
Jayadratha. Bhima reached where Arjuna 
was engaged and sounded his simhanada 
(lion-roar). Dharmaputra heard the lion-
roar of Bhima and knew that Arjuna was 
found alive. 
It was the fourteenth day and the battle 
raged fiercely at many points, between 
Satyaki and Bhurisravas at one place, 
between Bhima and Karna at another and 
between Arjuna and Jayadratha at a third.  
Drona remained at the main front resisting 
the attack of the Panchalas and the 
Pandavas, and leading a counter-offensive 
against them. 
Duryodhana arrived with his forces at the 
sector where Arjuna attacked Jayadratha, 
but was soon defeated and turned back. 
The battle thus raged long and furiously 
on more than one front. The armies were 
so deployed that each side was exposed to 
danger in its rear.  
Duryodhana was speaking to Drona:  
"Arjuna, Bhima and Satyaki have treated 
us 
with 
contempt 
and 
proceeded 
successfully to Jayadratha's sector and 
they are pressing hard on the Sindhu king. 
It is indeed strange that, under your 
command, our battle array should have 
been broken and our plans completely 
foiled. Everyone asks how it is that the 
great Drona with all his mastery of the 
science of war has been so badly 
outmaneuvered. 
What 
answer 
shall 
I 
make? I have been betrayed by you." 
Duryodhana thus, once again, bitterly 
reproached 
Drona, 
who 
replied 
unperturbed: 
"Duryodhana, your accusations are as 
unworthy as they are contrary to truth. 
There is nothing to be gained by talking 
about what is past and beyond repair. 
Think of what is to be done now." 
"Sir, it is for you to advise me. Tell me 
what should be done. Give your best 
consideration to the difficulties of the 
situation and decide and let us do it 
quickly." Puzzled and perplexed, thus did 
Duryodhana plead. 
Drona replied: "My son, the situation is no 
doubt serious. Three great generals have 
advanced, outmanoeuvring us. But they 
have as much reason to be anxious as we, 
for their rear is now left as open to attack 
as ours. We are on both sides of them and 
their position is not therefore safe. Be 
heartened, go up to Jayadratha again, and 
do all you can to support him. It is of no 
avail to dishearten oneself by dwelling on 
past defeats and difficulties. It is best I 
stay here and send you reinforcements as 
and when required. I must keep the 
Panchalas and Pandava army engaged 
here. Otherwise, we shall be wholly 
destroyed." 
Accordingly, Duryodhana went with fresh 
reinforcements again to where Arjuna was 
directing his attack on Jayadratha.  
The narrative of the fourteenth day's 
fighting at Kurukshetra shows that, even 
in the Mahabharata times, the modern 
tactics 
of 
turning 
and 
enveloping 
movements was not unknown. 
The advantages and risks of such strategy 
appear to have been fully understood and 
discussed even in those days. Arjuna's 
flanking 
manoeuvres 
perplexed 
his 
enemies greatly. The story of that day's 
battle between Bhima and Karna reads 
very much like a chapter from the 
narrative of a modern war.  
Bhima did not desire to fight Karna or 
remain long engaged with him. He was 
eager to reach where Arjuna was. But 
Radheya would, by no means, permit him 
to do this. He showered his arrows on 
Bhimasena 
and 
stopped 
him 
from 
proceeding.  
The contrast between the two warriors 
was striking. Karna's handsome lotus-like 
face was radiant with smiles when he 
attacked Bhima saying: "Do not show 
your back," "Now, do not flee like a 
coward," and so on.  
Bhima was all anger when taunted in this 
manner. He was maddened by Karna's 
smiles. The battle was fierce but Karna 
did everything with a smiling air of ease 
whereas Bhima's face glowed with rage 
and his movements were violent.  
Karna would keep at a distance and send 
his well-aimed shafts but Bhima would 
disregard the arrows and javelins failing 
thick upon him and always try to close 
with Karna.  
Radheya did everything he did, calmly 
and 
with 
graceful 
ease, 
whereas 
Bhimasena 
fumed 
and 
fretted 
with 
impatience, as he showed his amazing 
strength of limb.  
Bhima was red with bleeding wounds all 
over and presented the appearance of an 
Asoka tree in full blossom. But he minded 
them not, as he attacked Karna cutting 
bows in twain and smashing his chariot.  
When Karna had to run for a fresh chariot, 
there was no smile on his face. For anger 
rose in him, like the sea on a full moon 
day, as he attacked Bhima. Both showed 
the strength of tigers and the speed of 
eagles and their anger was now like that 
of serpents in a fury.  
Bhima brought before his mind all the 
insults and injuries which he and his 
brothers and Draupadi had suffered, and 
fought desperately, caring not for life.  
The two cars dashed against each other 
and the milk white horses of Karna's 
chariot and Bhimasena's black horses 
jostled in the combat like clouds in a 
thunderstorm.  
Karna's bow was shattered and his 
charioteer reeled and fell. Karna then 
hurled a javelin at Bhima. But Bhima 
parried it and continued pouring his 
arrows on Karna, who had taken up a 
fresh bow. 
Again and again did Karna lose his 
chariot. Duryodhana saw Karna's plight 
and calling his brother Durjaya said: "This 
wicked Pandava will kill Karna. Go at 
once and attack Bhima and save Karna's 
life." 
Durjaya went as ordered and attacked 
Bhima who, in a rage sent seven shafts 
which sent Durjaya's horses and his 
charioteer to the abode of Yama and 
Durjaya himself fell mortally wounded.  
Seeing his bleeding body wriggling on the 
ground like a wounded snake, Karna was 
overwhelmed with grief and circled round 
the hero, paying mournful honor to the 
dead. 
Bhima did not stop but continued the fight 
and greatly harassed Karna. Karna once 
again had to find a fresh chariot. He sent 
well aimed shafts and hit Bhima who in a 
fury hurled his mace at Karna and it 
crashed on Karna's chariot and killed his 
charioteer and horses and broke the 
flagstaff. Karna now stood on the ground 
with bent bow.  
Duryodhana now sent another brother to 
relieve 
Karna. 
Durmukha 
went 
accordingly and took Karna on his chariot.  
Seeing yet another son of Dhritarashtra 
come to offer himself up to death, Bhima 
licked his lips in gusto and sent nine 
shafts on the newly arrived enemy. And, 
even as Karna climbed up to take his seat 
in the chariot, Durmukha's armor was 
broken and he fell lifeless. 
When Karna saw the warrior bathed in 
blood and lying dead by his side, he was 
again overwhelmed with grief and stood 
motionless for a while.  
Bhima relentlessly continued his attack on 
Karna. His sharp arrows pierced Karna's 
coat of armor and he was in pain.  
But he too at once returned the attack and 
wounded Bhima all over.  
Still the Pandava would not stop and 
attacked Karna furiously. The sight of so 
many of Duryodhana's brothers dying for 
his sake one after another was too much 
for Karna. 
This, and the physical pain of his own 
wounds made him lose courage and he 
turned away defeated. But, when Bhima 
stood up on the field of battle red with 
wounds all over like a flaming fire and 
emitted a triumphant yell, he could not 
brook it but returned to the combat. 
87. PLEDGE RESPECTED 
DHRITARASHTRA, 
hearing 
of 
the 
slaughter of his sons and the check 
received by Karna, was desolate. "O 
Sanjaya, like moths falling in the fire, my 
sons are being destroyed. The stubborn 
Duryodhana has led the lads Durmukha 
and Durjaya, to their doom. Alas, I have 
lost these boys! The fool said: 'Karna, 
unrivalled among men for courage and the 
accomplishment of war, is on our side.  
Who then can defeat us? Even the gods 
cannot win a battle against me when 
Karna is on my side. What can these 
Pandavas do to me?' But now he has seen 
Karna beating a retreat when Bhimasena 
attacked him. Has he seen wisdom at least 
now? Alas, Sanjaya, my son has earned 
the undying hatred of the son of Vayu, 
Bhima, who has the strength of the god of 
death! We are indeed ruined!"  
Sanjaya replied: "O king, was it not you 
who brought about this unquenchable 
hatred, listening to the words of your 
foolish and stubborn son? To you indeed 
must be traced this greater disaster. You 
are now but reaping the fruit of your 
discarding the advice of Bhishma and the 
other elders. Blame yourself, king. Do not 
blame Karna and the brave warriors who 
have done their best in battle." 
After thus admonishing the blind king, 
Sanjaya 
proceeded to tell him what 
happened. Five sons of Dhritarashtra, 
Durmarsha, Dussaha, Durmata, Durdhara 
and Jaya, when they saw Karna put to 
flight by Bhima at once rushed on the 
latter.  
When Karna saw this, he was heartened 
and turned back to resume his attack. 
Bhimasena at first ignored the sons of 
Dhritarashtra and concentrated on Karna.  
But they became so violent in their assault 
that Bhima got incensed and, turning his 
attentions on them, disposed of all five of 
them. They lay dead on the field, with 
their horses and their charioteers.  
The young warriors with their bleeding 
wounds presented the appearance of a 
forest with trees, uprooted by a strong 
wind and lying flat on the ground with 
their beautiful red blossoms. 
When Karna saw another batch of princes 
slaughtered for his sake he fought more 
grimly than ever before. Bhima too was 
more violent than before, thinking of all 
the evil that Karna had wrought against 
the Pandavas.  
He used his bow so as to disarm Karna 
completely. His horses and charioteer 
were also laid low. Karna now jumped 
down from his chariot and hurled his 
mace at Bhima.  
But Bhima warded it off with shafts from 
his powerful bow and covered Karna with 
a shower of arrows and forced him to turn 
back and walk on foot. 
Duryodhana, who watched this combat, 
was greatly grieved and sent seven of his 
brothers 
Chitra, 
Upachitra, 
Chitraksha, 
Charuchitra, Sarasana, Chitrayudha and 
Chitravarman, to relieve Radheya.  
They gave battle to Bhima displaying 
great skill and energy. But fell dead one 
after another, for Bhima's passion was 
roused and his attack was irresistible.  
When Karna saw so many of the sons of 
Dhritarashtra 
sacrificing 
themselves 
for 
him, his face was wet with tears and he 
mounted a fresh chariot and began to 
attack Bhima with deadly effect.  
The two combatants clashed like clouds in 
a thunderstorm. Kesava, Satyaki and 
Arjuna were filled with admiration and 
joy as they watched Bhima fighting.  
Bhurisravas, 
Kripacharya, 
Aswatthama, 
Salya, Jayadratha and many other warriors 
of the Kaurava army also broke into 
exclamations, astonished at the way in 
which Bhima fought.  
Duryodhana was stung to the quick and 
burned with anger. Karna's plight caused 
him extreme anxiety. He feared Bhima 
would kill Radheya that day, and sent 
seven more of his brothers directing them 
to 
surround 
Bhima 
and 
attack 
him 
simultaneously. 
The seven brothers sent by Duryodhana 
attacked Bhima. But fell one after another, 
struck down by his arrows. Vikarna, who 
was killed last, was beloved of all.  
When Bhima saw him fall dead after a 
brave fight, he was deeply moved and 
exclaimed: "Alas, O Vikarna, you were 
just and knew what was dharma! You 
fought in loyal obedience to the call of 
duty. I had to kill even you. Indeed this 
battle is a curse upon us wherein men like 
you and the grandsire Bhishma have had 
to be slaughtered." 
Seeing Duryodhana's brothers, who came 
to help him, slain one after another in this 
manner, 
Karna 
was 
overwhelmed 
by 
anguish. He leant back on his seat in the 
chariot and closed his eyes unable to bear 
the sight.  
Then recovering control over his emotions 
he hardened his heart and began again his 
attack on Bhima. Bow after bow was 
broken up by Bhimasena's shaft, but 
Karna kept the battle.  
Eighteen times he had to take up a fresh 
bow. Karna had long ago discarded his 
smile and his face showed savage anger 
even as Bhima's. They now glared fiercely 
at each other as they fought.  
Yudhishthira now heard Bhima's roar rise 
above the tumult of battle, and heartened 
by it, he fought Drona with increased 
vigor.  
In the renewed and fierce battle between 
Bhima and Karna, Bhima lost his horses 
and charioteer. Soon his chariot also was 
smashed to pieces. Then, Bhima hurled 
his spear at Karna who was in his chariot 
and as Karna parried it with his shaft, 
Bhima advanced with sword and shield.  
But Karna broke the shield at once with 
his shafts. Then, Bhima whirled his sword 
and hurled it, and it cut Karna's bow into 
two and fell on the ground. But Karna 
took up yet another bow and assailed 
Bhima with arrows more fiercely than 
before.  
Bhima, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, 
sprang upon Karna. Radheya took cover 
behind 
his 
flagstaff 
and 
escaped 
destruction. 
Thereupon, 
Bhima 
jumped 
out of Karna's car down into the field of 
battle where, deprived of all arms, he used 
the elephants lying dead on the ground to 
protect himself from Karna's arrows and 
continued the fight.  
He picked up anything he could lay hands 
upon, wheels of broken chariots, the limbs 
of horses and elephants that were lying 
about, and hurling them at Karna, kept 
him engaged without interval. But this 
could not long continue and Bhima was 
soon at a great disadvantage. Karna said 
exultingly:  
"Foolish glutton, you do not know the 
science of war; why do you engage 
yourself in battle here? Go to the jungle 
and fill yourself with fruits and roots and 
grow fat. You are a savage, not fit for 
kshatriya 
battle. 
Get 
away!" 
Hurling 
insulting taunts at him, he made the 
helpless 
Bhima 
burn 
with 
rage, 
but 
mindful of his word to Kunti, refrained 
from killing him.  
"There, Arjuna! See how poor Bhima is 
being harassed by Karna," said Krishna. 
Dhananjaya's eyes burned red with wrath, 
when he saw the plight of his valiant 
brother. 
He bent his Gandiva bow and discharged 
his arrows on Karna who then gladly 
turned 
his 
attentions 
from 
Bhima 
to 
Arjuna. He had pledged his word to Kunti 
not to kill more than one of the Pandavas 
and he reserved that option for the great 
Arjuna.  
88. SOMADATTA'S END 
"THERE comes the valorous Satyaki," 
said 
Krishna, 
the 
charioteer, 
to 
Dhananjaya. "Your disciple and friend is 
marching 
up, 
triumphantly 
breaking 
through enemy ranks." 
"I do not like it, Madhava," replied 
Arjuna. "It was not right for him to have 
left Dharmaputra and come here to join 
me. Drona is there ever seeking an 
opportunity to seize Dharmaputra. Satyaki 
should have stuck to his post there to 
guard him. Instead, he has come here. Old 
Bhurisravas has intercepted Satyaki. It 
was a great mistake for Yudhishthira to 
have sent Satyaki away here." 
There 
was 
a 
family 
feud 
between 
Bhurisravas and Satyaki that made them 
inveterate foes.  
It had come about this way. When Devaki, 
who was to be the blessed mother of Sri 
Krishna, was a maiden, many princes 
competed for her hand and there was a 
great battle between Somadatta and Sini 
over it. 
Sini won, and on behalf of Vasudeva he 
placed Devaki in his chariot and took her 
away. Since that incident there was feud 
between the two clans, the Sini family and 
that of Somadatta. Satyaki was Sini's 
grandson.  
Bhurisravas was Somadatta's son. When 
they found themselves on opposite sides 
in the Kurukshetra battle, it was natural 
that, as soon as Bhurisravas saw Satyaki, 
the old warrior challenged Satyaki to 
battle.  
"Oh Satyaki," cried Bhurisravas, "I know 
you strut about thinking yourself a man of 
great prowess. Here now I have you in my 
power and will presently finish you. Long 
have I sought for this meeting. Like 
Indrajit 
destroyed 
Dasaratha's 
son 
Lakshmana, you will die today and go to 
the abode of Yama, gladdening the hearts 
of many a bereaved widow." 
Satyaki laughed. "Have done with your 
vaunting," he interrupted. "Words are not 
deeds and do not frighten fighting men. 
Demonstrate your valor in action and do 
not indulge in dry thunder like autumn 
clouds."  
After this exchange of words, the battle 
began, and the combat was as between 
two fierce lions. Their horses were killed, 
their bows were broken, and both were 
rendered chariotless.  
They were now standing on the ground 
fighting with swords and shields, till their 
shields were hacked to bits and their 
swords broken. Then they were locked in 
a deadly embrace without weapons.  
They rolled together on the ground. They 
leaped up and they sprang on each other. 
They fell down again and so the combat 
went on for a long while. 
Partha's mind was at the time concentrated 
on Jayadratha's movements and he did not 
watch this combat between Satyaki and 
the son of Somadatta.  
But his charioteer Krishna was deeply 
concerned 
about 
Satyaki's 
fate. 
For 
Krishna knew about their family feud. 
"Dhananjaya," said Krishna, "Satyaki is 
exhausted. Bhurisravas is going to kill 
him now." 
Still 
Arjuna 
was 
following 
only 
Jayadratha's movements.  
"Satyaki who came after an exhausting 
battle with the Kaurava forces has been 
forced to accept Bhurisravas' challenge," 
said Krishna again. "It is a most unequal 
battle. Unless we help him, beloved 
Yuyudhana will be slain." 
Even 
as 
Krishna 
was 
saying 
this, 
Bhurisravas lifted Satyaki up and brought 
him crashing to the ground and all the 
men 
around 
in 
the 
Kaurava 
army 
exclaimed: "Yuyudhana is dead!"  
Again Krishna importuned: "Satyaki is 
lying almost dead on the field, the best 
among the Vrishni clan. One who came to 
help you, is being killed before your eyes. 
You are looking on, doing nothing." 
Bhurisravas caught hold of the prostrate 
Satyaki and dragged him on the ground as 
a lion drags its elephant prey. 
Arjuna was in a great conflict of mind. 
"Bhurisravas has not been called to battle 
by me, nor has he challenged me to fight. 
How can I send my shaft at Bhurisravas 
when he is engaged with another? My 
mind recoils from such an act, although it 
is true a friend who came to help me is 
being slaughtered before my eyes." 
Just as Arjuna finished saying this to 
Krishna, the sky was darkened by a cloud 
of arrows sent by Jayadratha. Arjuna 
replied with a shower of arrows, but he 
constantly turned with pain to where 
Satyaki 
was 
in 
the 
mortal 
grip 
of 
Bhurisravas. 
Krishna again pressed Arjuna to consider 
Satyaki's condition. "O Partha, Satyaki 
has lost all his weapons and he is now in 
Bhurisravas' power, helpless." 
When Arjuna turned, he saw Bhurisravas 
with his foot on the prostrate body of 
Satyaki and sword upraised to slay him.  
Before Bhurisravas could deliver the fatal 
thrust, Arjuna shot an arrow which went 
with the speed of lightning and the next 
moment the uplifted arm fell chopped off 
to the ground still holding the sword. 
Bhurisravas, all amazed, turned and saw 
who had done it. 
"Son of Kunti," he exclaimed, "I had not 
expected this of you! It befits not a 
warrior to shoot from behind in this 
manner. I was engaged in combat with 
someone else and you have attacked me 
without notice. Indeed, then, no man can 
resist the evil influence of the company he 
keeps, 
as 
your 
unchivalrous 
conduct 
proves. Dhananjaya, when you go back to 
your brother Dharmaputra, what account 
are you going to give him of this valorous 
deed. Ah! Who taught you this low trick, 
Arjuna? Did you learn this from your 
father Indra or from your teachers Drona 
and Kripa? What code of conduct was it 
that permitted you to shoot your arrow at 
a man who was engaged in combat with 
another and could not so much as turn his 
eyes on you? You have done the deed of a 
low-bred fellow and foully besmirched 
your 
honor. 
You 
must 
have 
been 
instigated into it by the son of Vasudeva. 
It was not in your own nature to do it. No 
one with princely blood in his veins would 
think of such a dastardly deed. I know you 
have 
been 
incited 
to 
it 
by 
that 
contemptible Krishna."  
Thus did Bhurisravas with his right arm 
cut off, bitterly denounce Krishna and 
Arjuna in the Kurukshetra field. 
Said Partha: "Bhurisravas, you are old and 
age seems to have affected your judgment. 
You accuse Hrishikesa and me without 
cause. How could I look on doing nothing, 
when, before my eyes, you were in the act 
of killing my friend, who came and risked 
his life in battle on my behalf, one who 
was like a right hand to me, and whom 
you were going to stab when he was lying 
helpless on the ground? I would have 
deserved to go to hell if I had failed to 
intervene. You say, I have been ruined by 
keeping company with Madhava. Who in 
the wide world would not wish to be so 
ruined? You have spoken out of confused 
understanding. Satyaki who was weary 
and exhausted when he came here and 
who 
was 
inadequately 
armed, 
was 
challenged by you to give battle. You 
overcame him. Having been defeated, he 
lay on the ground, powerless. What code 
of honor enabled you to raise your sword 
to thrust it into the body of the fallen 
warrior and slay him? Do I not remember 
how you cheered the man who killed my 
boy 
Abhimanyu 
when 
he 
stood 
staggering, exhausted and weaponless, his 
coat of armor torn off?" 
Bhurisravas who heard this did not answer 
but spread his arrows on the ground with 
his left hand and made a seat for 
meditation.  
The old warrior sat in yoga and the sight 
deeply moved all the Kaurava soldiers. 
They cheered Bhurisravas and uttered 
reproaches against Krishna and Arjuna. 
Arjuna spoke: "Brave men, I am sworn to 
protect every friend within bow-shot of 
me and I cannot let an enemy kill him. It 
is my sacred pledge. Why do you blame 
me? It is not right to hurl reproaches 
without due thought." 
After saying this to the warriors in the 
field who reproached him, he turned to 
Bhurisravas and said: "O excellent among 
brave men, you have protected many who 
have gone to you for help. You know that 
what has happened is due to your own 
error. There is no justice in blaming me. If 
you like, let us all blame the violence 
which governs kshatriya life." 
Bhurisravas, who heard this, lowered his 
head in salutation. 
Satyaki now recovered consciousness and 
rose. Carried away by the impetuosity of 
his passion, he picked up a sword and, 
advancing to Bhurisravas, sitting in yoga 
on his seat of arrows, even when all 
around were shouting in horror and before 
Krishna and Arjuna, who rushed to the 
spot, could prevent him, with one swift 
and powerful cut, he struck off the old 
warrior's head which rolled down, while 
the body was still in the posture of 
meditation.  
The gods and the siddhas, who looked on 
from 
above 
the 
battlefield, 
uttered 
blessings on Bhurisravas. Everyone in the 
field condemned Satyaki's act. 
Satyaki maintained he was right, saying: 
"After I fell down senseless, this enemy of 
my family placed his foot on my prostrate 
figure and attempted to kill me. I may slay 
him in whatever posture he might choose 
to be." But none approved of his conduct. 
The slaying of Bhurisravas is one of the 
many situations of moral conflict woven 
into the story of the Mahabharata to 
demonstrate that, when hatred and anger 
have been roused, codes of honor and 
dharma are powerless to control them.  
89. JAYADRATHA SLAIN 
"THE decisive hour has come, Karna," 
said Duryodhana, "If before nightfall this 
day Jayadratha is not slain, Arjuna will be 
disgraced and he will kill himself, for not 
having redeemed his oath. With Arjuna's 
death, the destruction of the Pandavas is 
certain and this kingdom will be ours in 
unquestioned 
and 
absolute 
sovereignty. 
Dhananjaya swore this impossible oath in 
a moment of thoughtlessness, because the 
gods had willed it that he should be thus 
destroyed by his own hand. It seems my 
stars are now in the ascendant. We should 
not let this opportunity slip. We must see 
somehow that his challenge fails. The 
whole thing depends on you. Your great 
skill in battle is on trial today. Prove 
yourself this day. See the sun has sloped 
down in the west. Within the little time 
left before nightfall, I do not think it 
possible for Partha to reach Jayadratha. 
You, Aswatthama, Salya, Kripa, and I 
must guard Jayadratha and do all we can 
to see that he does not fall into Arjuna's 
hands during the next few hours before 
sunset." 
"My king," Karna replied "I have been 
wounded all over by Bhimasena, and am 
so weary that my limbs have no power in 
them. Still, I shall put forth all the strength 
that is in me. I only live to serve you." 
When Karna and Duryodhana were thus 
planning, Arjuna was engaged in a great 
attack on the Kaurava army and putting 
forth all his strength, so that before sunset 
he could break through to Jayadratha. 
Krishna put his Panchajanya in his mouth 
and blew a loud note in the rishabha 
swara, which was the signal for his own 
charioteer Daruka to arrive at once with 
his chariot.  
When it came, Satyaki took his place in it, 
and 
attacked 
Karna 
vigorously 
and 
skilfully, 
keeping 
him 
fully 
engaged. 
Daruka's mastery of driving and Satyaki's 
archery were such as brought down the 
gods to witness the combat.  
Karna's four chariot horses were disabled 
and the charioteer was unseated. Then the 
flagstaff was cut asunder and the chariot 
was smashed. The great Karna stood 
chariotless and the event produced a great 
flutter in the Kaurava army.  
Karna had to run and climb up into 
Duryodhana's chariot. Sanjaya here tells 
Dhritarashtra to whom he was relating the 
incident: "The greatest adepts in archery 
are Krishna, Partha and Satyaki. There is 
not a fourth to match them!"  
Arjuna 
broke 
through 
the 
Kaurava 
opposition 
and 
reached 
Jayadratha. 
Inflamed by the thought of the slaughter 
of Abhimanyu, and all the great wrongs 
inflicted by the Kauravas, Arjuna fought 
with fury.  
Savyasachin as he was, he discharged 
shafts from the Gandiva bow, now using 
one hand and now the other. He struck 
terror and confusion among his enemies, 
who felt as if Death had come to the 
battlefield with wide-open jaws. 
It is only the poet of the Mahabharata that 
can 
describe the combat that raged 
between Arjuna and Aswatthama and the 
other great warriors that protected the 
king of Sindhu. They fought fiercely but 
were all defeated and could not prevent 
Arjuna from reaching Jayadratha. The 
attack on Jayadratha began and the battle 
raged long. Both sides were constantly 
looking westwards, for the day was 
nearing its end. The Saindhava was no 
mean foe, and taxed to the full, Arjuna's 
strength and skill were hard put to it.  
The sun sank towards the horizon and 
reddened, but the battle did not cease. 
"There is but a very little time left. It 
seems Jayadratha has been saved and 
Arjuna's challenge has failed. The vow is 
unfulfilled and Arjuna is going to be 
disgraced," said Duryodhana to himself in 
great glee. 
Then, there was darkness and the cry went 
round in both armies: "It is sunset and 
Jayadratha has not been killed. Arjuna has 
lost." The Pandavas were depressed and 
there were shouts of joy in the Kaurava 
army. 
Jayadratha turned to the western horizon 
and thought within himself, "I am saved!" 
for he did not see the sun then and thought 
the time-limit of danger from Arjuna was 
over.  
At that moment, however, Krishna said to 
Arjuna: "Dhananjaya, the Sindhu raja is 
looking at the horizon. I have caused this 
darkness. The sun is still up and has not 
set. Do your work. This is the moment for 
it, for Jayadratha is off his guard." 
A shaft flew from the Gandiva bow, and, 
like a vulture swooping down on a 
chicken, carried away Jayadratha's head. 
"Listen, Arjuna," cried Krishna, "send 
your shafts in swift relays, so that the head 
may be supported from falling to the earth 
and borne into Vriddhakshatra's lap."  
And Arjuna sent his wonderful arrows 
that carried away the head in the air. It 
was a strange sight. Vriddhakshatra was in 
his ashrama sitting in the open absorbed in 
his evening meditation with eyes closed, 
when his son's head with beautiful black 
hair and golden earrings gently dropped 
into his lap.  
The old king finished his meditation and 
got up, when the head rolled down and 
fell on the ground. And, as ordained, 
Vriddhakshatra's 
head 
burst 
into 
a 
hundred fragments. Jayadratha and his 
father together reached the abode of the 
brave. 
Kesava, 
Dhananjaya, 
Bhima, 
Satyaki, 
Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas blew their 
conchs and Dharmaraja who heard the 
triumphant noise knew that it meant that 
Arjuna had redeemed his oath and that the 
Saindhava had been slain.  
Then, Yudhishthira led his army fiercely 
against Drona. It was nightfall, but on the 
fourteenth day of the battle the rule of 
cease-fire at sunset was not observed. As 
the passions rose from day to day, one by 
one the rules and restraints broke down. 
90. DRONA PASSES AWAY 
ALL those who have heard the story of 
the 
Mahabharata 
know 
about 
Ghatotkacha, Bhimasena's famous son by 
his asura wife. There are two young men 
among 
the 
Mahabharata 
figures 
who 
embody all the qualities of heroism, 
fortitude, 
strength, 
courage, 
and 
amiability. 
They 
are 
Arjuna's 
son, 
Abhimanyu, 
and 
Bhima's 
son, 
Ghatotkacha. Both of them gave up their 
lives on the Kurukshetra battlefield. 
Towards 
the 
latter 
part 
of 
the 
Mahabharata fight, the hatred roused on 
both sides did not find satisfaction in 
battle conducted during the daytime and 
close at nightfall. On the fourteenth day, 
when the sunset, they did not cease 
fighting but went on with it in torchlight. 
The Kurukshetra field presented a strange 
sight, the like of which had not been seen 
before in Bharatadesa. The generals and 
soldiers on both sides were engaged in 
battle, with thousands of torches burning 
and using signals specially devised for 
nighttime. 
Ghatotkacha and his troops of asuras who 
are strongest at night, found darkness an 
additional 
advantage 
and 
violently 
attacked 
Duryodhana's 
army. 
Duryodhana's heart sank within him when 
he saw thousands of his men destroyed by 
Ghatotkacha and his demon army moving 
in the air and attacking in weird and 
unexpected ways.  
"Kill this fellow at once, Karna, for 
otherwise, soon our whole army will cease 
to be. Finish him without further delay." 
Thus begged all the perplexed Kauravas 
of Karna. 
Karna was himself angry and bewildered, 
having just been wounded by one of the 
asura's arrows. He had with him no doubt 
the spear of unerring effect which Indra 
had given to him. But it could be used 
only once, and he had carefully husbanded 
it for exclusive use on Arjuna with whom 
a 
decisive 
encounter 
he 
knew 
was 
inevitable.  
But in the confusion and wrath of that 
eerie midnight melee, Karna, impelled by 
a sudden urge, hurled the missile at the 
young giant. Thus was Arjuna saved, but 
at 
great 
cost. Bhima's beloved son, 
Ghatotkacha, 
who 
from 
mid-air 
was 
showering his deadly arrows on the 
Kaurava army, dropped dead, plunging 
the Pandavas in grief. 
The battle did not stop. Drona spread fear 
and destruction in the Pandava army by 
his relentless attacks. "O Arjuna," said 
Krishna, "there is none that can defeat this 
Drona, fighting according to the strict 
rules of war. We cannot cope with him 
unless dharma is discarded. We have no 
other way open. There is but one thing 
that will make him desist from fighting. If 
he hears that Aswatthama is dead, Drona 
will lose all interest in life and throw 
down 
his 
weapons. 
Someone 
must 
therefore tell Drona that Aswatthama has 
been slain."  
Arjuna shrank in horror at the proposal, as 
he could not bring himself to tell a lie. 
Those who were nearby with him also 
rejected the idea, for no one was minded 
to be a party to deceit. 
Yudhishthira stood for a while reflecting 
deeply. "I shall bear the burden of this 
sin," he said and resolved the deadlock! 
It was strange. But when the ocean was 
churned at the beginning of the world and 
the dread poison rose threatening to 
consume the gods, did not Rudra come 
forward to swallow it and save them? To 
save the friend who had wholly depended 
on him, Rama was driven to bear the sin 
of killing Vali, in disregard of the rules of 
fairplay. So also, now did Yudhishthira 
decide to bear the shame of it, for there 
was no other way. 
Bhima lifted his iron mace and brought it 
down on the head of a huge elephant 
called Aswatthama and it fell dead. After 
killing 
the 
elephant 
Aswatthama, 
Bhimasena 
went 
near 
the 
division 
commanded by Drona and roared so that 
all might hear.  
"I have killed Aswatthama!" Bhimasena 
who, until then, had never done or even 
contemplated an ignoble act, was, as he 
uttered these words, greatly ashamed.  
They knocked against his very heart, but 
could they be true? Drona heard these 
words as he was in the act of discharging 
a Brahmastra. "Yudhishthira, is it true my 
son has been slain?" Dronacharya asked 
addressing Dharmaputra.  
The acharya thought that Yudhishthira 
would not utter an untruth, even for the 
kingship of the three worlds. 
When Drona asked thus, Krishna was 
terribly perturbed. "If Yudhishthira fails 
us now and shrinks from uttering an 
untruth, we are lost. Drona's Brahmastra is 
of 
unquenchable 
potency 
and 
the 
Pandavas will be destroyed," he said. 
And Yudhishthira himself stood trembling 
in horror of what he was about to do, but 
within him also was the desire to win. 
"Let it be my sin," he said to himself and 
hardened his heart, and said aloud: "Yes, 
it is true that Aswatthama has been 
killed."  
But, as he was saying it, he felt again the 
disgrace of it and added in a low and 
tremulous 
voice, 
"Aswatthama, 
the 
elephant" words which were however 
drowned in the din and were not heard by 
Drona. 
"O king, thus was a great sin committed," 
said Sanjaya to the blind Dhritarashtra, 
while relating the events of the battle to 
him. 
When the words of untruth came out of 
Yudhishthira's mouth, the wheels of his 
chariot, which until then always stood and 
moved four inches above the ground and 
never touched it at once came down and 
touched the earth.  
Yudhishthira, who till then had stood 
apart from the world so full of untruth, 
suddenly became of the earth, earthy. He 
too desired victory and slipped into the 
way of untruth and so his chariot came 
down to the common road of mankind.  
When Drona heard that his beloved son 
had been slain, all his attachment to life 
snapped. And desire vanished as if it had 
never been there. When the veteran was in 
that 
mood, 
Bhimasena 
loudly 
spoke 
indicting him in harsh words:  
"You 
brahmanas, 
abandoning 
the 
legitimate functions of your varna and 
taking to the Kshatriya profession of arms, 
have brought ruin to princes. If you 
brahmanas had not gone astray from the 
duties belonging to you by birth, the 
princes would not have been led to this 
destruction. You teach that non-killing is 
the highest dharma and that the brahmana 
is the supporter and nourisher of that 
dharma. Yet, you have rejected that 
wisdom which is yours by birth, and 
shamelessly undertaken the profession of 
killing. It was our misfortune that you 
descended to this sinful life." 
These 
taunts 
of 
Bhimasena 
caused 
excruciating pain to Drona who had 
already lost the will to live. He threw his 
weapons away and sat down in yoga on 
the floor of his chariot and was soon in a 
trance.  
At 
this 
moment 
Dhrishtadyumna 
with 
drawn sword, came and climbed in to the 
chariot and heedless of cries of horror and 
deprecation from all around he fulfilled 
his destiny as the slayer of Drona by 
sweeping off the old warrior's head. And 
the soul of the son of Bharadwaja issued 
out in a visible blaze of fight and mounted 
heavenwards. 
The Mahabharata is a great and wonderful 
story. The sorrows of human life are 
painted with sublime beauty and rolled 
out in a grand panorama. Behind the story 
of errors and sorrows the poet enables us 
to have a vision of the Transcendent 
Reality. Thus it is that the Mahabharata, 
though a story, has come to be a book of 
dharma. This book, in style and substance, 
is altogether different from tales and 
romances. In modern novels, dramas and 
pictures, exciting scenes are enacted, the 
hero 
passes 
through 
dangers 
and 
difficulties and finally marries a woman 
whom he loves. Or else everything seems 
to go on happily but suddenly things go 
wrong and terrible misfortune happens 
and the curtain drops. This is the art 
scheme of ordinary sensational stories. 
The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are 
quite a different kind of artistic creation. 
When we read them, our inner being is 
seized and cleansed, so to say, by being 
passed 
alternately 
through 
joys 
and 
sorrows, and we are finally lifted above 
both and taken to the Transcendent and 
Real.  
91. THE DEATH OF KARNA 
WHEN Drona died, the princes of the 
Kaurava 
army 
installed 
Karna 
as 
Generalissimo. Karna stood up in his 
gorgeous war chariot driven by Salya. The 
dauntless confidence of his bearing and 
his great renown as a warrior heartened 
the Kauravas. The battle again began. 
Readers of the stars were consulted and 
the Pandavas chose the propitious hour for 
grim battle. Arjuna led the attack on 
Karna, 
supported 
by 
Bhimasena 
immediately behind his chariot.  
Duhsasana made a concentrated attack on 
Bhima and sent a shower of arrows at 
him. Bhima chuckled and said to himself. 
"I have this wretch now safe in my hands. 
I shall today redeem my promise to 
Draupadi. Too long has my oath waited 
for performance." 
As Bhima thus bethought himself of what 
Duhsasana had done to Draupadi, the 
anger within him blazed up uncontrollably 
and throwing down all his weapons, he 
jumped from his chariot and leapt upon 
Duhsasana like a tiger on its prey, hurled 
him down and broke his limbs. 
"Wicked beast, is this the wretched hand 
that held Draupadi by the hair? Here, I 
tear out the root from your body. If there 
be any here wishing to help you, let him 
come forward and try!" 
Glaring hatefully at Duryodhana as he 
roared this challenge, Bhimasena tore 
Duhsasana's 
arm 
out 
and 
threw 
the 
bleeding limb on the battlefield.  
And then he fulfilled the terrible oath he 
had taken thirteen years before. He sucked 
and drank the blood from his enemy's 
body like a beast of prey and danced on 
the bloody field, mad with passion. "I 
have done it!" he roared. "The oath I 
swore against this great sinner has been 
redeemed. It only remains to redeem my 
oath 
as 
regards 
Duryodhana. 
The 
sacrificial fire is ready. Let that victim 
also prepare."  
The scene made everyone shudder. Even 
great Karna was shaken as he saw Bhima 
in this ecstasy of wrath. "Do not flinch," 
said Salya to Karna. "It does not befit you 
to show any sign that may be mistaken for 
fear. When Duryodhana stands quivering 
in despair; it is not right that you also 
should 
lose 
heart. 
After 
the 
great 
Duhsasana's death, the army's hope rests 
solely on you. You must now bear the full 
burden. Like the gallant warrior you are, 
seek single combat with Arjuna, and win 
eternal glory on earth or the soldier's 
heaven!" At these words, Karna recovered 
his courageous spirit. With eyes red with 
wrath and unshed tears, he bade Salya 
drive the chariot towards Arjuna.  
"Enough of fighting," said Aswatthama 
addressing Duryodhana earnestly. "Let us 
terminate this disastrous enmity. Beloved 
friend, make peace with the Pandavas. 
Stop the battle." 
"What? Did you not hear the words that 
the stubborn Bhima uttered when like a 
ravening beast, he drank human blood and 
danced over my brother's mangled body? 
What talk can there be now of peace? 
Why do you speak vain words!" said 
Duryodhana. Saying thus, he ordered a 
fresh disposition of the forces, and gave 
the command for attack.  
Then followed a great battle. The son of 
Surya sent a dazzling arrow, which spat 
fire and made for Arjuna, like a serpent 
with its flaming double-tongue out. Then 
Krishna, Arjuna's charioteer, at the nick of 
time, 
pressed 
the vehicle down five 
fingers deep in the mud, so that the 
serpent shaft just missed Partha's head but 
struck off his helmet! Arjuna was red with 
shame and anger and he fixed a dart on his 
bow to make an end of Karna.  
And Karna's fated hour was come, and as 
had been foretold, the left wheel of his 
chariot suddenly sank in the bloody mire. 
He jumped down on the ground to lift the 
wheel up from the mud. 
"Wait a minute!" he cried. "My chariot 
has sunk in the ground. Great warrior as 
you are, and knowing dharma as you do, 
you 
would 
certainly 
not 
take 
unfair 
advantage 
of 
this 
accident. 
I 
shall 
presently set my car right and give you all 
the battle you want."  
Arjuna 
hesitated. 
Karna 
was 
now 
somewhat perturbed on account of the 
mishap. He remembered the curse that had 
been pronounced on him, and again 
appealed to Arjuna's sense of honor. 
Krishna 
intervened. 
"Ha, 
Karna!" 
be 
exclaimed, 
"it 
is 
well 
that 
you 
too 
remember 
that 
there 
are 
things 
like 
fairplay and chivalry! Now that you are in 
difficulty, you remember them indeed. 
But when you and Duryodhana and 
Duhsasana and Sakuni dragged Draupadi 
to the Hall of Assembly and insulted her, 
how was it you forgot them utterly? You 
helped to inveigle Dharmaputra, who was 
fond of play but was unskilled at it, to 
gamble, and you cheated him. Where had 
your fairplay hidden itself then? Was it 
fairplay to refuse to give to Yudhishthira 
his kingdom when according to the pledge 
the twelve years of forest life and the 
thirteenth 
year 
incognito 
were 
duly 
completed? What had happened to the 
dharma 
you 
appeal 
for 
now? 
You 
conspired with the wicked men who 
sought to poison and kill Bhima. You 
acquiesced in the plot to burn the 
Pandavas alive when sleeping in the 
palace of wax into which they had been 
lured. What had happened to dharma all 
that time? What did dharma tell you when 
violent hands were laid on Draupadi and 
you were looking on enjoying the sight? 
Did you not then mock at her saying: 
'Your husbands have left you unprotected, 
go and marry another husband'? The 
tongue that was not ashamed to utter those 
words now talks of chivalry. Chivalry 
indeed! When a mob of you surrounded 
the young Abhimanyu and shamelessly 
slew him, was that chivalry? Wicked man, 
do not talk now of chivalry and fairplay, 
for you have never honored them!"  
When Krishna was denouncing him in this 
manner in order to urge Arjuna to prompt 
action, Karna bent his head in shame and 
uttered 
not 
a 
word. 
Karna 
silently 
ascended the chariot leaving the wheel 
still stuck in the mud and took his bow 
and sent an arrow at Arjuna with unerring 
aim and such power that it stunned him 
for a moment.  
Karna utilised the respite won, to jump 
down again and hurriedly tried to lift the 
chariot wheel up. But the curse was too 
strong for him and fortune had deserted 
the great warrior.  
The wheel would not budge, though he 
strove with all his great strength. Then he 
tried to recall the mantras of mighty astras 
he had learnt from Parasurama, but his 
memory failed in the hour of his need, 
even as Parasurama had foretold.  
"Waste no more time, Arjuna," cried 
Madhava. "Send your shaft and slay your 
wicked enemy."  
Arjuna's mind was wavering. His hand 
hesitated to do what was not chivalrous. 
But when Krishna said this, the poet says: 
"Arjuna accepted this command of the 
Lord and sent an arrow which cut and 
severed the head of the Radheya."  
The poet had not the heart to impute this 
act to Arjuna who was the embodiment of 
nobility. It was the Lord Krishna that 
incited Arjuna to kill Karna when he was 
vainly trying to raise his chariot out of the 
mud in which it had stuck. According to 
the code of honor and laws of war 
prevailing then, it was wholly wrong. 
Who could bear the responsibility for 
breaches of dharma except the Lord 
Himself?  The lesson is that it is vanity to 
hope, through physical violence and war, 
to put down wrong. The battle for right, 
conducted through physical force leads to 
numerous wrongs and, in the net result, 
adharma increases.  
92. DURYODHANA 
WHEN Duryodhana beheld Karna's death, 
his grief knew no bounds. Kripacharya 
was 
deeply 
moved 
by 
Duryodhana's 
anguish of heart and said: "Moved by 
ambition and greed we placed too great a 
burden 
on 
friends. 
They 
have 
uncomplainingly borne it and laid down 
their lives on the battlefield and attained 
the happy regions above. There is but one 
course left to you to make peace with the 
Pandavas. Do not, O King, any longer 
continue this ruinous fight." 
Even at that moment of deep despair, 
Duryodhana did not relish this counsel. 
"Perhaps, there was a time for that, but it 
is long past. What talk can there be of 
peace between the Pandavas and us with 
all this inexpiable blood between us, the 
blood of our dearest and theirs? If I 
surrender in order to escape death, how 
can I escape the contempt of the world? 
What happiness can I hope to have in a 
life so ignobly saved? And what joy can I 
hope to find in sovereignty, secured by a 
peace after my brothers and relatives have 
all been slain?" 
These words of Duryodhana were lustily 
cheered by the others. They supported his 
stand and they chose Salya and gave him 
the supreme command from then on. 
Salya was mighty of limb and as brave as 
any of the warriors who had been killed. 
The 
army 
was 
arrayed 
under 
his 
leadership and the battle raged fiercely. 
On the side of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira 
now led the attack personally against 
Salya. It astonished everyone to see how 
the man, who was till then the very 
incarnation of gentle ness, fought so 
furiously. 
The battle was equal for a long while, 
when Yudhishthira hurled at Salya, his 
spear that went straight and struck him. 
Like the great flagstaff at the end of a 
festive function, Salya's body lay lifeless 
on the field, crimson with blood.  
When Salya, the last of the great generals, 
fell dead, the Kaurava army lost all hope. 
The 
surviving 
sons 
of 
Dhritarashtra, 
however, joined together and attacked 
Bhima from all sides. He slew them all. 
The son of Vayu had nourished his 
burning anger for thirteen years from the 
time Draupadi was insulted in the Hall of 
Assembly. He said to himself now: "I 
have not lived in vain, but Duryodhana 
still lives," and smiled grimly. 
Sakuni led the attack on Sahadeva's 
division. 
After 
a 
while, 
Sahadeva 
discharged a sharp-edged sword-arrow 
saying: "Fool, here is the reward for your 
great sin." It went straight and cut through 
Sakuni's neck like a sword. And the head, 
which was at the root of all the wicked 
deeds of the Kauravas, rolled on the 
ground.  
Left leaderless, the wreck of the broken 
army scattered and fled in all directions, 
pursued and slaughtered to a man by the 
exulting victors.  
"'Thus utterly was destroyed thine army of 
eleven Akshauhinis, O! Bharata, out of 
the thousands of kings, who espoused thy 
cause in their pride and might, only 
Duryodhana 
could 
be 
seen 
on 
that 
battlefield, fainting and sore wounded," 
said Sanjaya, describing the debacle to the 
blind king. 
After doing, in vain, all he could to rally 
his 
defeated 
army, 
Duryodhana, 
left 
almost alone, took up his mace and 
walked towards a pool of water. His 
whole frame was burning like fire, and 
water attracted him. "The wise Vidura 
knew what would happen and he told us," 
he said to himself, as he entered the water. 
Of what avail is wisdom that comes too 
late? What has been done must produce its 
result that has to be suffered. That is the 
law. Yudhishthira and his brothers arrived 
there in relentless, pursuit of their great 
enemy. 
"Duryodhana!" 
exclaimed 
Yudhishthira, 
"after destroying family and tribe, would 
you yourself escape death by concealing 
yourself in this pond? Where is your pride 
now? Have you no shame? Come up and 
fight. A kshatriya by birth, do you shrink 
battle and death?"  
Stung to the quick by these words, 
Duryodhana replied with dignity: "I have 
not come here, Dharmaputra, a fugitive 
for my life. It was not fear that brought 
me here. I stepped into the water to cool 
the fire that is raging within me. I neither 
fear death nor wish to live, but why 
should I fight? The earth has now nothing 
left that I came to fight for! All those who 
stood by me have been slain. My desire 
for kingdom is gone. I leave the world to 
you without a rival. Enjoy it in undisputed 
sovereignty." 
Yudhishthira replied: "Now, that is really 
generous, especially after you said you 
would not allow us even a needle-point of 
land. When we begged for peace and 
entreated you to give us a portion, you 
spurned our proposal. Now, you say we 
may take it all. It is not for kingdom or 
land that we fight. Must I recount all your 
sins? The wrongs you did us, and the 
outrage you perpetrated on Draupadi, 
cannot be expiated except with your life."  
Sanjaya, who related the events to the 
blind old king, here said: "When your son 
Duryodhana heard these harsh and cruel 
words spoken by Dharmaputra, he at once 
rose from the water, mace in hand." 
Stepping out of the pool, the unfortunate 
Duryodhana said: "Come, one by one, all 
of you, for I am single. You five will 
surely not join together and attack me who 
am alone and without armor, weary and 
wounded all over."  
Yudhishthira replied sharply: "If indeed it 
be wrong for many to join together and 
attack a single person, pray tell us how 
Abhimanyu was attacked and killed? Did 
you not consent to many combining and 
attacking that boy, standing all alone 
amidst your crowd? Yes, when men face 
misfortune, they see and preach dharma 
and chivalry to others. Wear your coat of 
armor. Choose any of us you like and 
fight. Die and go to swarga or win and be 
king." 
Accordingly, the combat began between 
Bhima and Duryodhana. Sparks of fire 
flew 
when 
their 
maces 
clashed. 
Duryodhana and Bhima were equal in 
strength and skill, and the battle raged 
long, and the issue hung doubtful. Those, 
who stood watching, were debating as to 
whom would win. Krishna said to Arjuna 
that Bhima would redeem the oath he 
swore in the Hall of Assembly and smash 
Duryodhana's thighs. Bhima heard this 
and, at that moment, the memory of the 
great outrage came vividly to his mind.  
He leaped like a lion and came down with 
his mace on Duryodhana's thighs and 
broke them and Duryodhana fell heavily 
on the ground, wounded to death.  
Bhima jumped on the prostrate body of 
his enemy, stamped on his head with his 
heavy foot and danced a terrible dance. 
"Cease, Bhima," cried Dharmaraja. "You 
have paid off the debt. Duryodhana is a 
prince and a cousin. It is not right to put 
your foot on his head."  
Said Krishna:"Soon the wicked man's soul 
will depart from the body. Sons of Pandu, 
Duryodhana and his friends have been 
slain. Why linger here? On to your 
chariots." 
When Krishna said this, the face of the 
fallen Duryodhana glowed like a blazing 
fire with anger and hatred. Turning his 
eyes towards Krishna be said:  
"By base tricks you contrived the death of 
warriors, who fought bravely according to 
the laws of war. You could not have 
dreamt of victory in a fair fight with 
Karna or Bhishma or Drona. Have you not 
a spark of shame left?" 
Even dying, Duryodhana felt no regret for 
all that he had done. 
"Duryodhana," said Krishna, "vainly do 
you accuse others. Greed and pride of 
power led you to unnumbered wicked 
deeds and you are reaping as you sowed."  
"Wretch!" replied Duryodhana. "Living, I 
was a great prince, generous friend, and a 
terrible foe. All human joys, such joys as 
kings wish for in vain, and even Gods do 
not despise, have been mine, in their 
fullness. A warrior's death is the fitting 
crown of such a life. Dying, I go 
triumphantly to swarga to join my friends 
and my brothers who have gone there 
already and are waiting to welcome me. 
You remain here below, your objects 
defeated and yourselves the object of 
contempt of all kshatriyas. I do not mind 
Bhima putting his foot on my head as I lie 
helpless on the ground with legs broken. 
What care I? In a few minutes more will 
not the feet of crows and vultures settle on 
my head?"  
When Duryodhana said this, flowers were 
showered down from the heavens by the 
gods. Inordinate desire took Duryodhana 
into the wrong path, whence ensued anger 
and numerous breaches of dharma. But no 
one could question the unconquerable 
spirit of Dhritarashtra's son. 
93. THE PANDAVAS REPROACHED 
WHEN the war was nearing its end, 
Balarama arrived at Kurukshetra after 
completing his tour of holy places. He 
came just when Bhima and Duryodhana 
were engaged in their last mortal combat. 
He saw Bhima aiming the deadly blow 
which broke Duryodhana's thighs, and his 
anger flamed up at this great breach of the 
rules of single combat. 
"Fie upon you all! Would any kshatriya 
hit below the navel? This Bhima has 
offended the law most disgracefully," he 
exclaimed and impatiently going up to his 
brother Krishna, shouted:  
"You can look on and tolerate all this. But 
I cannot bear to see such unclean 
fighting!" 
Saying 
this 
he 
advanced 
towards 
the 
offending 
Bhima 
with 
upraised 
plough. 
The 
plough 
was 
Balarama's weapon on supreme occasions, 
as the discus was Krishna's. Krishna was 
alarmed when he saw his elder brother 
advancing in a passion towards Bhima.  
He rushed forward and, intercepting him, 
said: "The Pandavas are our friends and 
closest relations. They have been the 
victims of insufferable wrongs at the 
hands of Duryodhana. When Draupadi 
was insulted in the Assembly Hall, Bhima 
vowed: 'I will one day in battle break the 
two thighs of Duryodhana with this mace 
and kill him.' He proclaimed this solemn 
oath at that time and everyone has known 
it. It is the duty of a kshatriya to fulfil the 
vow he has solemnly taken. Do not let 
your anger mislead you and do not be 
unjust to the innocent Pandavas. You 
should, before condemning Bhima, take 
into account all the wrongs that the 
Kauravas have done to the Pandavas. 
Nothing but error can result if one 
proceeds to judge conduct without taking 
into account the chain of events leading 
up to it. You cannot snatch a particular act 
out of its context and proceed to give 
judgment 
on 
it 
alone 
without 
gross 
injustice. The era of Kali has arrived, 
when the laws of a previous age cannot 
apply. It was not wrong for Bhima to 
strike below the navel an enemy who had 
wickedly contrived against his life on 
many 
occasions. 
It 
was 
because 
of 
Duryodhana's foul instigation that Karna 
sent a shaft from behind and broke 
Abhimanyu's 
bowstring 
when 
he 
was 
defending himself against heavy odds. 
Arjuna's young son was attacked by 
numerous warriors who surrounded him, 
when he stood all by himself in the field, 
deprived of bow and chariot, and in a 
most 
cowardly 
manner, 
killed 
him. 
Duryodhana thought evil and practised 
deception from the time of his birth and 
has brought about the destruction of his 
people. There is no sin in Bhima killing 
this man. Bhima bore the wrongs done 
and kept his wrath within himself for 
thirteen long years. Duryodhana knew 
well that Bhima had sworn to break his 
thighs and kill him. When he challenged 
the aggrieved Pandavas to battle, he knew 
very well that he invited Bhima to make 
good his oath. How can you think that it 
was wrong for Bhima to do this?" 
Krishna's 
words 
did 
not 
change 
Balarama's 
opinion, 
but 
his 
anger 
subsided. 
"Duryodhana 
will 
attain 
the 
happy regions reserved for the brave. 
Bhima's fame has been tarnished for all 
time. It will be said among men that the 
son of Pandu broke the laws of war in 
attacking 
Duryodhana. 
It 
will 
remain 
forever a great blot on his good name. I 
hate to stay here any longer." So saying 
the indignant Balarama immediately left 
for Dwaraka.  
"Yudhishthira, why this strange silence?" 
asked Krishna.  
"O Madhava, it hurts me to see Bhima 
leap on cousin Duryodhana's mortally 
wounded body and trample on his head. I 
see the end of the glory of our race. We 
were wronged by the Kauravas. I know 
the full measure of grief and anger in 
Vrikodara's heart, and don't wish to blame 
him beyond reason. We have killed 
Duryodhana, 
who 
was 
afflicted 
by 
uncontained 
greed 
and 
poverty 
of 
understanding. What serves it now to 
debate the ethics of it or nicely to weigh 
the propriety of a much wronged man's 
revenges?" 
Yudhishthira was greatly oppressed in 
mind. When men transgress the law, 
extenuations and excuses are of no avail 
in giving mental satisfaction.  
Arjuna, of penetrating intellect, was silent. 
He did not show approval of Bhima's act. 
Nor did he say anything by way of 
detraction. The rest of the people, who 
were 
there, 
were 
however 
loud 
in 
condemnation of Duryodhana and were 
reminding one another of all his misdeeds 
and errors. Krishna turned towards them 
and said:  
"Warriors, it is not proper that we go on 
speaking against an enemy who has been 
defeated and is lying mortally wounded. 
We should not speak ill of a dying man. 
He was stupid and brought about his own 
end. He fell into the company of bad men 
and was ruined. Let us go."  
Duryodhana, who was stretched on the 
ground in intense, agony, when he heard 
Krishna say this, went into a paroxysm of 
rage. He half raised himself on his arms in 
spite 
of 
the 
excruciating 
pain, 
and 
exclaimed: 
"Wretch! Son of a slave! Was not your 
father Vasudeva Kamsa's slave? You have 
no business to sit or move with princes. 
You speak like a shameless wretch. I saw 
you instigate Bhima to aim his blow at my 
thigh! Do you think I did not see you, 
making as though casually talking to 
Arjuna, pointing to your thigh, but really 
indicating to Bhima that he should strike 
me on the thighs, disregarding the laws of 
single combat? Till then it had been equal 
battle. You have neither pity nor shame. 
Did you not contrive the death of the 
grandsire 
Bhishma 
through 
stratagem? 
You advised Sikhandin to be placed in 
front when attacking Bhishma, knowing 
that the grandsire would scorn to fight a 
woman, and would let himself be mortally 
wounded without resistance. You brought 
about the end of Dronacharya through 
making Dharmaputra utter a falsehood. 
You were the father of that deadly lie that 
issued from Yudhishthira's mouth, and 
made Dronacharya throw his bow away. 
Did you not look on without protest, and 
rejoice, 
when 
that, 
wretch 
Dhrishtadyumna attacked and killed the 
acharya 
who 
had 
stopped 
fighting, 
throwing away his weapons, and settled 
down in yoga posture for meditation on 
the Supreme? Was it not you who 
wickedly contrived to make Karna hurl 
the fatal spear at Ghatotkacha instead of 
reserving it for Arjuna as he had all along 
resolved to do? O great sinner, surely it 
was you who instigated Satyaki to butcher 
Bhurisravas when his right arm had been 
foully cut off and he stopped fighting and 
spread his arrows for a seat for holy 
meditation. It was you who brought about 
the death of Karna by inducing Arjuna to 
attack him in a cowardly manner when he 
was engaged in lifting his chariot wheel 
which had sunk and stuck in the mud in 
the field of battle. Oh worthless man, sole 
cause of our destruction, the whole world 
has condemned your act when by sorcery 
you made it appear as if the sun had set. 
You made Jayadratha, the Sindhu king, 
believe that the day was over and he was 
past danger, and thus he was slain when 
he was off his guard." 
Thus 
did 
Duryodhana 
pour 
his 
denunciation against Krishna and then, 
exhausted by the pain of his wounds and 
the violence of his rage, he fell prostrate 
again. 
"Son of Gandhari," said Krishna, "why do 
you let your anger add to the pain of your 
last moments? It is your own misdeeds 
that have brought about your end. Do not 
attribute it to me. Bhishma and Drona had 
to die on account of your sins. So also 
were you the cause of the death of Karna 
and others. Need I recount all the wrongs 
that you were guilty of against the sons of 
Pandu? What punishment can be too 
severe for the great outrage, which you 
inflicted on Draupadi? The animosities 
and passions that resulted from your 
misdeeds cannot be made ground for 
condemning others. All the deceptions 
and lapses you charge us with were forced 
on us by reason of your wicked conduct. 
You have paid off on the battlefield the 
debt incurred by your greed. But you are 
dying the death of a brave man. You will 
go to the happy regions reserved for 
kshatriyas who lay down their lives on the 
field of battle."  
"Krishna, I go to swarga with my friends 
and relatives. But you and your friends 
will live on earth to suffer," said the 
stubborn 
Duryodhana. 
"I 
studied 
the 
Vedas. I have given gifts ordained by law 
and I have reigned supreme over all the 
sea-girt earth. While I lived, I stood upon 
the humbled heads of foes. All human 
joys, such joys as even the Gods cannot 
despise and kings sigh for in vain, the 
very pinnacle of power, were mine. Dying 
now, such death as warriors deem the 
crown of kshatriya life, I go to meet in 
heaven my friends and brothers gone 
before, eager to welcome me. Who is 
more blest, I, or you who, doomed to 
linger 
here, 
mourning 
for 
slaughtered 
friends in desolate homes, find the long 
sought triumph but ashes in your mouth?" 
said Duryodhana. And the gods showered 
flowers down on the dying warrior and the 
gandharvas played music and the sky was 
illuminated. Vasudeva and the Pandavas 
felt small.  
"There is truth," said Krishna, "in what 
Duryodhana said. You could not have 
defeated him by fair means. This wicked 
man was invincible in battle." 
94. ASWATTHAMA 
WHEN 
Aswatthama 
heard 
how 
Duryodhana 
lay 
mortally 
injured, 
and 
learnt the details of the combat, his 
righteous anger swelled like the sea. The 
deception, practised by the Pandavas in 
order to bring about his father's end, had 
been rankling in his mind.  
Now, when he learnt how Duryodhana 
had been stricken down mortally against 
all rules of chivalry, he went to the spot 
where Duryodhana was lying and there 
took an oath that he would that night send 
the Pandavas to the abode of Yama. 
Duryodhana, who was in the last physical 
agony of departing life, was transported 
with joy when he heard Aswatthama take 
this oath. He immediately ordered those 
who stood nearby to install Aswatthama 
as Supreme Commander of the Army with 
due ceremony and, when that was over, 
said to Him: "All my hopes are in you." 
It was sunset and the forest was in utter 
darkness when under a big banian tree 
Kripacharya, Kritavarma and Aswatthama 
halted for rest. They were so greatly 
fatigued that Kripacharya and Kritavarma 
fell fast asleep as soon as they lay down.  
But Aswatthama did not get sleep, for 
sorrow, 
indignation 
and 
hatred 
burnt 
within him. He was listening to the noises 
that the nocturnal birds and prowling 
beasts began to make as the night 
advanced. He was turning over in his 
mind how to execute his promise to 
Duryodhana. 
On the branches of the banian tree, under 
which the three warriors were resting, 
hundreds of crows roosted. They were all 
quiet and asleep until a big owl came and 
began to attack the birds one after another 
and kill them. When Aswatthama saw the 
nocturnal bird of prey tear the helpless 
crows, he got an idea. The crows that 
could not see at night flew round and 
round helplessly and fell victims to the 
owl that attacked them violently. 
"These wicked Pandavas and the Panchala 
that 
killed 
my 
father 
and 
all 
their 
supporters can easily be killed by us, if we 
surprise them when they are sleeping in 
their tents at night even as this owl is 
attacking these blind crows. Thus can I 
avenge the deeds of foul play they have 
practised on us. I am deeply indebted to 
this bird of prey from whom I have 
received the teaching. There is no offence 
in adopting plans to suit one's altered 
circumstances. If we can lawfully attack 
an enemy, when his army is tired or when 
his forces are scattered, why then should 
not we, who have lost our armies, attack 
our enemies when they are asleep? There 
can be nothing wrong in it. Indeed it is 
only thus that we can punish and defeat 
these 
Pandavas 
who 
have 
achieved 
successes through foul play.  We have no 
other course open."  
Aswatthama made up his mind and he 
immediately woke up Kripacharya and 
informed him of his plan. Kripacharya, 
who heard it, was astonished.  
"This can never be," said he. "It is wholly 
wrong. To attack men who have retired to 
sleep, has never been done before. It 
would be an unprecedented crime against 
the 
laws 
of 
kshatriya 
conduct. 
Aswatthama, for whom are we fighting? 
The man for whose sake we joined in this 
war has been fatally wounded and his end 
has arrived. We have discharged our 
obligations most loyally. We fought our 
best for the greedy and wrongheaded 
Duryodhana but we failed irretrievably. 
There is no purpose now in our continuing 
the fight and it is folly to do so. Let us go 
to 
Dhritarashtra 
and 
the 
faultless 
Gandhari, and place ourselves at their 
disposal. Let us take counsel of wise 
Vidura also. They will tell us what lies 
before us to do." 
When 
Kripacharya 
spoke 
thus, 
Aswatthama's 
grief 
and 
indignation 
increased and he spoke bitterly: 
"Everyone feels sure that what he thinks is 
the only right and proper thing to do. 
One's understanding naturally limits one's 
vision. These Pandavas have been guilty 
of the foulest conduct. They killed my 
noble and trustful father through a lie. 
They have killed Duryodhana against the 
laws of chivalry. I have no doubt in my 
mind that what I propose to do is quite 
proper vengeance for all these foul deeds. 
It is only if I carry out this plan that I can 
possibly repay my debt to my king and to 
my father. I have decided on it and I do 
not propose to alter my plan. I am going 
tonight to the tents where they are 
sleeping having cast off their armor and 
there 
I 
will 
kill 
the 
Pandavas 
and 
Dhrishtadyumna while they are asleep."  
Kripacharya was deeply grieved to hear 
Aswatthama 
speak 
thus: 
"You 
have 
attained a great name among men," he 
pleaded, "Your spotless character will by 
this be blemished, even like a milk-white 
cloth bespattered with blood. Never could 
it be right to kill sleeping men. Desist 
from this."  
"Sir, 
what 
are 
you 
talking? 
These 
Pandavas butchered my father when he 
had thrown away all his weapons and had 
sat down in prayer. These men have 
breached the embankment of dharma and 
released the flood, and not a, drop of 
dharma is now left! Karna, who was on 
the ground putting right the wheel of his 
chariot, was murdered by these lawless 
rascals. Bhima has killed Duryodhana 
with a blow below the navel. What 
dharma has been left for us to follow? The 
Pandavas have, once for all, destroyed the 
wall of dharma. Why should we make 
research into law and chivalry when 
dealing with these ruffians who have 
attained successes by destroying both? If 
by killing the sleeping Panchalas, who 
butchered my great father, I may be 
doomed to rebirth in the body of a foul 
bird or of a wriggling worm, I do not care. 
I seek such a birth!"  
Saying this and, without waiting for an 
answer, Aswatthama proceeded to harness 
his horses and get his chariot ready to 
start. When he was about to leave 
Kripacharya and Kritavarma cried: "Stop. 
What are you resolved upon doing, 
Aswatthama? We cannot approve of it, 
but neither can we desert you in your 
desperate enterprise. The path you are 
bent on treading, we shall also follow. The 
sin you are resolved upon, let us share 
also." So, they went along with him. Thus 
does evil grow! One transgression begets 
the next and thus evil grows from evil 
submerging righteousness. Evil flourishes 
on retaliation. 
They 
reached 
the 
Pandava 
camp. 
Dhrishtadyumna had doffed his armor and 
was plunged in deep slumber in his tent. 
Aswatthama leapt on the sleeping warrior 
and, before he could put himself into a 
posture of defence, cruelly kicked him to 
death. 
The 
same 
process 
was 
relentlessly 
repeated until all the Panchalas and all the 
sons of Draupadi were killed one by one 
when they were plunged in sleep in their 
tents. 
After having done this deed, the like of 
which had never before been considered 
possible among kshatriyas, Kripacharya, 
Kritavarma and Aswatthama came out of 
the tents and set fire to the camp. When 
the fire spread, the sleeping soldiers were 
awakened and fled hither and thither in 
confusion, even like the crows on the 
banian tree under which they had rested in 
the forest, and they were mercilessly 
slaughtered by Aswatthama. 
"We 
have 
done 
our 
duty," 
said 
Dronacharya's son. "Let us go and give 
the glad news to Duryodhana, if we can 
reach him, before he expires. Let him die 
pleased."  
The three of them accordingly hurried to 
Duryodhana. 
95. AVENGED 
"O, DURYODHANA, you are yet alive, 
hear the news and rejoice! All the 
Panchalas have been slaughtered. The 
sons of the Pandavas have also been all 
done to death. The entire army of theirs 
has been destroyed. We made a night 
attack on them when they were asleep. 
There are only seven survivors now on the 
Pandava side. On our side, Kripacharya, 
Kritavarma and I remain." 
Thus 
said 
Aswatthama 
to 
the dying 
Duryodhana who, on hearing this, slowly 
opened his eyes and, with struggling 
breath, gasped out these words:  
"Aswatthama, you have indeed done for 
me what neither the great Bhishma nor the 
valiant Karna could achieve! You have 
gladdened my heart and I die happy." 
Saying this, Duryodhana expired. 
When he saw the unexpected destruction 
of his army as a result of the attack during 
sleep, Yudhishthira gave way to grief and 
broke down: 
"At the very moment of victory, we have 
been totally defeated. The vanquished 
have 
indeed 
triumphed. 
Draupadi's 
children, who survived the onslaught of 
the formidable Karna, have, by our 
unwariness, been crushed and destroyed 
like vermin. We have allowed ourselves to 
be destroyed like a merchant ship which, 
having successfully crossed the big seas, 
returns home but capsizes in a ditch and is 
lost."  
Draupadi 
was 
overwhelmed 
by 
inconsolable 
grief. 
She 
came 
to 
Dharmaputra's side and wept. "Is there no 
one to avenge my children's slaughter, by 
destroying this great sinner Aswatthama?" 
she cried. 
When 
she 
said 
this, 
the 
Pandavas 
immediately went out in search of the 
murderer. They looked for him in all sorts 
of places and found him, at last, on the 
bank of the Ganga, hiding himself behind 
Vyasa.  
When he saw the Pandavas and Janardana 
approaching, Aswatthama quietly took up 
a blade of grass and charged it with the 
mantra of destruction and sent it forward 
saying: "May this destroy the race of the 
Pandavas." And it went straight to the 
womb of Uttara who bore in her the son of 
Abhimanyu.  
The race of the Pandavas would have been 
destroyed thereby but for the intervention 
of Sri Krishna who saved the child in the 
mother's womb. This child was Parikshit 
who was later crowned by Yudhishthira 
when the Pandavas retired to the forest.  
Aswatthama pried out the shining jewel 
that was part of his head and gave it to 
Bhima, acknowledging his defeat, and 
went away to the forest. Bhima took the 
great jewel and, going to Draupadi said: 
"Angel of spotless purity, this is for you. 
The man, who killed your beloved sons, 
has been vanquished. Duryodhana has 
been destroyed. I have drunk the blood of 
Duhsasana. I have avenged the great 
outrage and discharged my debts." 
Draupadi took the jewel and, going up to 
Yudhishthira bowed and said: "Faultless 
king, it befits you to wear this in your 
crown." 
96. WHO CAN GIVE SOLACE? 
WHEN the battle was over, Hastinapura 
was a city of mourning. All the women 
and children were weeping and lamenting 
their slain, nearest and dearest. With many 
thousands 
of 
bereaved 
women 
accompanying, Dhritarashtra went to the 
field of battle. At Kurukshetra, the scene 
of terrible destruction, the blind king 
thought of all that had passed, and wept 
aloud. But, of what avail was weeping? 
"O king, words of consolation addressed 
to a bereaved person do not remove his 
grief. Thousands of rulers have given up 
their lives in battle for your sons. It is now 
time that you should arrange for proper 
funeral ceremonies for the dead," said 
Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.  
"It is not right to grieve for those who die 
in battle. When souls have left their 
bodies, there is nothing like relationship, 
nothing like brother or son or relative. 
Your sons have really no connection with 
you. Relationship ends with death, being 
only a bodily connection and a mere 
minor incident in the soul's eternal life. 
From the nowhere do lives come, and, 
with death, they again disappear into 
nowhere. Why should we weep for them? 
Those who die in battle after a heroic fight 
go as guests to receive Indra's hospitality. 
Grieving for what is past, you cannot gain 
anything in the nature of dharma, pleasure 
or wealth." Thus, and in many more ways, 
did the wise and good Vidura try to 
assuage the king's grief.  
Vyasa 
also 
approached 
Dhritarashtra 
tenderly and said: "Dear son, there is 
nothing that you do not know and which 
you have to learn from me. You know 
very well that all living beings must die. 
This great battle came to reduce earth's 
burden as I have heard from Lord Vishnu 
Himself. That is why this calamity could 
not 
be 
prevented. 
Henceforth, 
Yudhishthira is your son. You should try 
to love him and in that way bear the 
burden of life, giving up grief." 
Making his way, through the crowd of 
weeping women Yudhishthira approached 
Dhritarashtra 
and 
bowed 
before 
him. 
Dhritarashtra embraced Yudhishthira, but 
there was no love in that embrace. 
Then Bhimasena was announced to the 
blind king. "Come," said Dhritarashtra. 
But Vasudeva was wise. He gently pushed 
Bhima aside and placed an iron figure 
before the blind Dhritarashtra, knowing 
the 
old 
king's 
exceeding 
anger. 
Dhritarashtra hugged the metal statue to 
his bosom in a firm embrace and then the 
thought came to him of how this man had 
killed everyone of his sons. And his wrath 
increased to such a pitch that the image 
was crushed to pieces in his embrace.  
"Ha! My anger has deceived me," cried 
Dhritarashtra. "I have killed dear Bhima." 
Then Krishna said to the blind king:  
"Lord, I knew that it would be thus and I 
prevented the disaster. You have not 
killed Bhimasena. You have crushed only 
an iron image that I placed instead before 
you. May your anger be appeased with 
what you have done to this image. Bhima 
is still alive."  
The king was composed somewhat and he 
blessed Bhima and the other Pandavas 
who then took leave of him and went to 
Gandhari. 
Vyasa 
was 
with 
Gandhari. 
"Oh 
queen,"said the rishi, "be not angry with 
the Pandavas. Did you not tell them even 
when the battle began: 'Where there is 
dharma, there surely will be victory'? And 
so it has happened. It is not right to let the 
mind dwell on what is past and nurse 
one's anger. You must now call to aid 
your great fortitude." 
Gandhari said: "Bhagavan, I do not envy 
the victory of the Pandavas. It is true that 
grief for the death of my sons has robbed 
me of my understanding. These Pandavas 
also are my sons. I know that Duhsasana 
and Sakuni brought about this destruction 
of our people. Arjuna and Bhima are 
blameless. Pride brought this battle about 
and my sons deserve the fate they have 
met. I do not complain about it. But then, 
in Vasudeva's presence, Bhima called 
Duryodhana to battle and they fought. 
And, 
knowing 
that 
Duryodhana 
was 
stronger and could not be defeated in 
single combat, Bhima struck him below 
the navel and killed him. Vasudeva was 
looking on. This was wrong and it is this 
that I find it impossible to forgive." 
Bhima, who heard this, came near and 
said: "Mother, I did this to save myself in 
battle. Whether it was right or wrong, you 
should bear with me. Your son was 
invincible in combat and so I did in self-
protection what was undoubtedly wrong. 
He 
called 
Yudhishthira 
to 
play 
and 
deceived him. We had been wronged by 
your son in so many ways. He would not 
give back the kingdom, of which be took 
unlawful possession. And you know what 
your son did to blameless Draupadi. If we 
had killed your son on the spot, when he 
misbehaved in the Hall of Assembly, 
surely you would not have blamed us. 
Bound 
by 
Dharmaraja's 
vow, 
we 
restrained ourselves with difficulty then. 
We have since discharged honor's debt 
and found satisfaction in battle. Mother, 
you should forgive me." 
"Dear son, if you had left but one out of 
my hundred sons and killed all the rest 
and satisfied your anger, I and my old 
husband would have found solace in that 
surviving son for the rest of our lives. 
Where is Dharmaputra? Call him." She 
said. 
Hearing this, Yudhishthira trembled as he, 
with clasped hands, approached Gandhari, 
whose eyes were bound in a cloth in loyal 
lifelong 
penance 
for 
her 
husband's 
blindness. He bowed low before her and 
said softly: 
"Queen, 
the 
cruel 
Yudhishthira, 
who 
killed your sons, stands before you fit to 
be cursed. Do curse me who have 
committed great sin. I care not for life or 
for kingdom." Saying this, he fell on the 
ground and touched her feet.  
Gandhari heaved a deep sigh and stood 
mute. She turned her head aside knowing 
that if, through the cloth with which her 
eyes were bound, her vision fell on the 
prostrate 
Yudhishthira 
he 
would 
be 
reduced to ashes on the spot. But through 
a little space in the cloth, even as she 
turned her face away, her eyes fell on the 
toe of the prostrate Yudhishthira. At once, 
says the poet, the toe was charred black.  
Arjuna knew the power of bereaved 
Gandhari's wrath, and hid himself behind 
Vasudeva. The wise and good Gandhari 
suppressed all her anger and blessed the 
Pandavas and sent them to Kunti.  
Gandhari turned to Draupadi, who was in 
lamentation, having lost all her sons. 
"Dear 
girl," 
said 
Gandhari. 
"Do 
not 
grieve. Who can give solace to you and 
me? It is through my fault that this great 
tribe has been destroyed altogether."  
97. YUDHISHTHIRA'S ANGUISH 
THE Pandavas performed the til and 
water ceremonies for the peace of the 
souls of the dead warriors and camped on 
the bank of the Ganga for a month.  
One 
day, 
Narada 
appeared 
before 
Yudhishthira. 
"Son, 
through 
Krishna's 
grace, the valor of Arjuna and the power 
of your dharma, you were victorious and 
you are the sovereign lord of the land. Are 
you happy?" he asked.  
Yudhishthira replied: "Bhagavan, it is true 
the 
kingdom 
has 
come 
into 
my 
possession. But my kinsmen are all gone. 
We have lost sons that were dear. This 
victory appears to me but a great defeat. O 
Narada, we took our own brother for an 
enemy and killed him, even Karna who 
stood rooted like a rock in his honor and 
at whose valor the world wondered. This 
terrible act of slaying our own brothers 
was the result of our sinful attachment to 
our possessions. Karna, on the other hand, 
kept the promise he gave to our mother 
and abstained from killing us. Oh! I am a 
sinner, a low fellow who murdered his 
own brother. My mind is troubled greatly 
at this thought. Karna's feet were so much 
like our mother's feet. In the large hall, 
when that great outrage was committed 
and my anger rose, when I looked at his 
feet, which were so much like Kunti's feet, 
my wrath subsided. I remember that now 
and my grief increases."  
So saying, Yudhishthira heaved a deep 
sigh. Narada told him all about Karna and 
the curses that had been pronounced on 
him on various occasions.  
Once, when Karna saw that Arjuna was 
superior to him in archery, he approached 
Drona and entreated him to teach him how 
to wield the Brahmastra. Drona declined 
saying it was not open to him to instruct 
any but a brahmana of faultless conduct or 
a kshatriya who had purified himself by 
much penance. Thereupon, Karna went to 
the 
Mahendra 
hills 
and 
deceived 
Parasurama by saying that he was a 
brahmana and became his disciple. From 
him he obtained instruction in archery and 
the use of many astras.  
One day, when Karna was practising with 
his bow in the forest near Parasurama's 
asrama, 
a 
brahmana's 
cow 
was 
accidentally hit and killed. The brahmana 
was angry and uttered a curse on Karna: 
"In battle, your chariot wheels will stick in 
the mud and you will be done to death, 
even like this innocent cow which you 
have killed."  
Parasurama 
was 
exceedingly 
fond 
of 
Karna and taught him all the archery he 
knew and instructed him fully in the use 
and the withdrawing of the Brahmastra.  
One day, however, he discovered that the 
disciple was not a brahmana. It happened 
tha an an insect bit a hole into Karna's 
thigh when one afternoon the teacher had 
fallen asleep on Karna's lap. Karna bore 
the acute pain quietly and did not stir, lest 
the master should wake up. The warm 
blood trickling from the wound woke up 
Parasurama. When he saw what had 
happened, he was angry. 
"You are a kshatriya; otherwise you could 
not have borne this physical pain without 
stirring. Tell me the truth. You are not a 
brahmana. 
You 
have 
deceived 
your 
teacher. Fool! When your hour comes, 
your knowledge of astras will fail you and 
what you have learnt from me through 
deception will not avail you." 
Parasurama's wrath against kshatriyas is 
well known and, when he discovered that 
Karna was a kshatriya, he cursed him thus 
in his anger. 
Karna was free in making gifts. One day, 
Indra, who was Arjuna's father, came in 
the garb of a brahmana and begged of 
Karna for a gift of the divine earrings and 
armor with which he had been born. 
Karna took them out and gave them away 
accordingly. 
From 
that 
time, 
Karna's 
strength was reduced. 
"Karna's pledge to his mother Kunti that 
he would not kill more than one of the 
five of you, Parasurarna's curse, the anger 
of the brahmana whose cow was killed by 
Karna, the way in which his charioteer 
Salya depressed him by underrating his 
valor and Vasudeva's stratagems, these 
combined to bring about Karna's end. Do 
not grieve believing that you alone caused 
his 
death." 
Thus 
said 
Narada, 
but 
Yudhishthira was not consoled by these 
words.  
"Do not blame yourself, son, for Karna's, 
death," said Kunti. "His father, the sun 
lord 
himself, 
pleaded 
with 
him. 
He 
begged of him to give up the wicked-
hearted Duryodhana and join you. I too 
tried hard. But he would not listen to us. 
He brought his end on himself."  
"You 
deceived 
us, 
mother" 
said 
Yudhishthira, "by hiding the secret of his 
birth from us. You became thus the cause 
of this great sin. May women never be 
able to keep a secret henceforth." 
This 
is 
the 
poet's 
story 
of 
how 
Yudhishthira cursed all women in his 
anguish over having killed his own elder 
brother. It is a common notion that 
women cannot keep secrets. And this 
story is a beautiful conception illustrating 
that popular belief.  
It may be that in worldly affairs, it is an 
advantage to be able to keep secrets. But it 
is not great virtue from the point of view 
of moral character, and women need not 
grieve over an incapacity of this kind, if 
indeed Kunti's legacy still persists.  
The affectionate temperament natural to 
women may perhaps incline them to 
openness. But some women do keep 
secrets very well indeed, and not a man 
possess this ability either. It is a fallacy to 
attribute the differences that arise out of 
training and occupation on nature itself 
and imagine some qualities as peculiar to 
a sex.  
98. YUDHISHTHIRA COMFORTED 
YUDHISHTHIRA'S 
pain 
of 
mind 
increased everyday as he thought of all the 
kinsmen that had been killed. He was 
stricken with intense remorse and decided 
he must give up the world go to the forest 
and do penance to expiate his sin.  
"I see no joy or good," he said to his 
brothers, in taking up the office of king or 
in worldly enjoyment. Do rule the land 
yourselves leaving me free to go to the 
forest."  
Arjuna talked of the nobility of family life 
and the entire good one may do without 
taking sanyasa. Bhimasena also spoke and 
harshly. 
"You talk, alas"' he said, "like a dull-
witted person who has committed to 
memory the texts of the sastras without 
understanding their sense. Sanyasa is not 
the dharma of kshatriyas. The duty of a 
kshatriya, is to live an active life and 
perform his proper task, not to go to the 
forest renouncing activity." 
Nakula also contested the propriety of 
Dharmaputra's proposal and insisted that 
the path of work was the right one to 
follow and the way of sanyasa was beset 
with difficulties.  
Sahadeva 
also 
argued 
likewise 
and 
entreated: "You are my father, my mother, 
my teacher, as well as brother. Do not 
leave us, bear with us." 
Draupadi also spoke. "It was right we 
killed Duryodhana and his men. Why 
should we regret it? Among the duties of a 
king is included the inflicting of just 
punishment. It cannot be avoided and is 
an essential part of the ruler's duty. You 
have meted just punishment too evildoers. 
There 
is 
no 
cause 
whatsoever 
for 
contrition. It is now your sacred duty to 
take up the burden of governing the land 
according to dharma. Cease grieving." 
Then Vyasa spoke to Yudhishthira at 
length and explained where his duty lay, 
pointing out precedents, and persuaded 
him to go to the city and take up the 
burden of ruling the land.  
Yudhishthira 
was 
duly 
crowned 
at 
Hastinapura. Before taking up the duties 
of the State, Yudhishthira went to where 
Bhishma lay on his bed of arrows 
awaiting his death, and took his blessing 
and instruction in dharma. This instruction 
of Bhishmacharya to king Yudhishthira is 
the 
famous 
Santiparva 
of 
the 
Mahabharata. After the discourse was 
over, Bhishma's soul passed out. The king 
went to the Ganga and offered libations, 
in accordance with ancient custom, for the 
peace of the departed soul. 
After 
the 
ceremony 
was 
over, 
Yudhishthira went up the bank. There, as 
he stood for a while, all the tragic events 
came back to his mind, and overcome by 
intense grief, he fell senseless on the 
ground, like an elephant struck down by 
the hunter.  
Bhima went up to his big brother and 
caressed him tenderly and spoke to him 
soothing words. Dhritarashtra also came 
up and said to Yudhishthira:  
"You should not grieve like this. Arise 
and, assisted by your brothers and friends, 
reign over the kingdom that awaits your 
rule. Your duty now is to do what 
appertains to the office of king. Leave 
grief to Gandhari and me. You achieved 
victory in battle in accordance with the 
dharma 
of 
warriors. 
The 
duties 
appertaining to that victory await your 
attention now. Fool that I was, I did not 
pay heed to the words of Vidura and 
committed a great error. I listened to the 
ignorant 
words 
of 
Duryodhana 
and 
deceived myself. Like gold seen in a 
dream 
the 
glory 
has 
vanished. 
My 
hundred sons have disappeared into the 
world of nowhere. But I have you as my 
son now. Do not grieve."  
99. ENVY 
AFTER 
the 
libation 
ceremony 
for 
Bhishma was over, Vyasa narrated to 
grief-stricken Yudhishthira an episode in 
Brihaspati's life. The wisest of men are 
sometimes affected by envy and suffer 
thereby. Brihaspati, teacher to the gods 
themselves, was master of all knowledge. 
He was learned in all the Vedas and all the 
sciences, yet he was once the victim of 
this 
debasing 
emotion 
and 
suffered 
disgrace.  
Brihaspati 
had 
a 
younger 
brother, 
Samvarta, who was also a person of great 
learning and a very good man. Brihaspati 
was, for this reason, stricken with envy of 
his brother.  
In this world men become envious of 
others, just because the others are good, 
while they themselves are not so good, 
and they cannot bear this. It is strange 
indeed that men should not suffer even 
virtue in others.  
Brihaspati harassed Samvarta in many 
ways. When he could not stand it any 
more, 
poor 
Samvarta 
put 
on 
the 
appearance of an eccentric and wandered 
from place to place, and spent his days in 
that way to escape from his brother's 
persecution.  
King Marutta of the Ikshwaku dynasty 
made great penance and obtained from the 
Lord of Kailasa a great goldmine in the 
Himalayas and, with his resources thus 
augmented, he decided to perform a great 
Yajna.  
Marutta requested Brihaspati to conduct 
the yajna for him. But Brihaspati feared 
that Marutta would, as a result of the 
yajna, overshadow the gods who were his 
charge.  
He refused to comply with the king's 
invitation, despite his pressing entreaties. 
Thereupon, king Marutta, who had come 
to 
know 
about 
Samvarta 
found 
his 
whereabouts and approached him with the 
invitation to conduct his yajna.  
He at first refused and tried to avoid the 
honor, but finally yielded. This further 
increased 
Brihaspati's 
envy 
of 
his 
unfortunate brother. 
"Here is this enemy of mine, Samvarta, 
going to conduct king Marutta's great 
yajna. What shall I do now?" Thus did 
Brihaspati brood over it until his envy 
affected his health. His health declined 
rapidly and he became thin and pale. His 
condition grew worse everyday, until it 
attracted the attention of Indra himself.  
Indra, chief of the gods, approached the 
divine preceptor and saluting him asked: 
"Lord, why are you ill? What has caused 
this languishing? Do you sleep well? Do 
the attendants serve you properly? Do 
they anticipate your wishes and not wait 
to 
be 
told? 
Do 
the 
gods 
behave 
courteously towards you or has there been 
any lapse in this respect?" 
To Indra's anxious inquiry, Brihaspati 
replied: "Deva raja, I sleep on a good bed 
and in right time. The attendants serve me 
with 
all 
devotion. 
There 
is 
nothing 
wanting in the respect and courtesies 
shown by the gods." Then his voice failed 
and he could not proceed. So great was his 
prostration of spirit. 
"Why are you grieved?" asked Indra 
affectionately. "Why have you grown thin 
and bloodless? Tell me what troubles your 
mind." 
Brihaspati then told Indra about it all. 
"Samvarta is going to conduct a great 
yajna. It is this that has made me wan and 
thin. I cannot help it," said he. Indra was 
surprised. 
"Learned brahmana, there is no object of 
desire that is not already yours. You are 
wise and learned, and the gods themselves 
have accepted you as their priest and wise 
counselor. What harm can Samvarta do to 
you? There is nothing you can lose on 
account of him. Why do you needlessly 
take upon yourself this suffering by mere 
envy?"  
It was amusing that Indra should so far 
and so humanly forget his own history as 
to give counsel of good conduct. But 
Brihaspati refreshed his memory on the 
point and asked: "Would you yourself 
delightedly watch your enemy's power 
growing? Judge me by how you would 
have felt had you been in my position. I 
beg of you to save me against this 
Samvarta. You must find a way to put this 
man down."  
Indra sent for Agni and said to him: "Go 
and stop the yajna of Marutta somehow."  
The god of fire agreed and went on this 
mission. The trees and the creepers along 
his path caught fire and the earth trembled 
as he marched roaring. 
He presented himself before the king in 
his divine form.  
The king was mightily pleased to see Agni 
stand 
before 
him. 
He 
ordered 
the 
attendants to do all the usual honors of 
hospitality. "Let him be duly seated. Have 
his feet laved and bring the gifts proper to 
his greatness," said the king, and this was 
done. 
Agni then explained why he had come. 
"Do give up this Samvarta. If you require 
a priest, I shall bring Brihaspati himself to 
help you." 
Samvarta, who heard this, was indignant. 
The wrath of one who led the strict life of 
a brahmacharin was exceedingly potent. 
"Stop this chatter!" he said to Agni. "Do 
not let my anger burn you up." 
Fire 
reduces 
things 
to 
ashes, 
but 
brahmacharya can burn up fire itself! 
At Samvarta's anger Agni, trembling like 
an aspen leaf, retired quickly. He returned 
to Indra and told him what had happened.  
The king of the gods could not believe the 
story. "Agni, you burn up other things in 
the world. How can anything burn you? 
What is this story of Samvarta’s angry 
eyes reducing you to ashes?"' 
"Not so, king of the gods," said Agni. 
"Brahmic power and the potency born of 
brahmacharya are not unknown to you." 
Agni thus reminded Indra of what the 
latter had suffered; incurring the wrath of 
those whom had attained Brahmic power. 
Indra did not wrangle but called a 
Gandharva had said: "Now, Agni has 
failed. I want you to go as my messenger 
and ask Marutta to give up Samvarta. Tell 
him that if he does not, he will incur my 
wrath and be destroyed."  
The Gandharva went accordingly to king 
Marutta and faithfully conveyed Indra's 
message and warning. 
The king would not listen. "I cannot be 
guilty of the deadly sin of deserting a 
trusting friend," said the king: "I cannot 
give up Samvarta." 
The Gandharva said: "O king, how can 
you survive, when Indra hurls his bolt at 
you?"  
Even as he said this, the clouds above 
thundered and everyone knew that the god 
of the thunderbolt was coming, and 
trembled in fear.  
The king was in great fear and entreated 
Samvarta to save him. 
"Fear not," said Samvarta to the king, and 
he proceeded to put the power of his 
penance into action.  
Indra, who had come to do battle, was 
compelled to change over to benevolent 
peace and to take part in the yajna as the 
radiant god of sacrifices. He received the 
burnt offering in proper form and retired. 
Brihaspati's plan of envy failed miserably. 
Brahmacharya 
triumphed. 
Envy 
is 
a 
deadly sin. It is a universal disease. If 
Brihaspati who could defeat the goddess 
of knowledge herself in learning became a 
victim to envy, what is there to say about 
ordinary mortals? 
100. UTANGA 
WHEN the battle was over, Krishna bade 
farewell to the Pandavas and went to 
Dwaraka. While on his way, he met his 
old 
brahmana 
friend 
Utanga. 
Krishna 
stopped and descending from his chariot 
saluted the brahmana.  
Utanga 
returned 
the 
greeting 
and 
proceeded to make the usual inquiries 
about the health and welfare of relatives. 
"Madhava, do your cousins the Pandavas 
and the Kauravas love one another as 
brothers should? Are they well 
and 
flourishing?" he asked. 
The innocent recluse had not heard about 
the great battle that had been fought. 
Krishna was astounded at the question of 
his brahmana friend. For a while, he stood 
silent not knowing what to say in reply. 
Then 
he 
softly 
disclosed 
what 
had 
happened. 
"Sir, a terrible battle had been fought by 
the Pandavas and the Kauravas, I tried 
hard and applied every means to prevent 
the fight and make peace between them. 
But they would not listen. Almost all of 
them have perished on the field of battle. 
Who can stop the hand of fate?" Then he 
related all that had happened.  
When Utanga heard the narrative, he was 
exceedingly wroth. With eyes red with 
indignation 
he 
spoke 
to 
Madhava: 
"Vasudeva, were you there standing by 
and did you let all this happen? You have 
indeed failed in your duty. You have 
surely practised deceit and led them to 
destruction. Prepare now to receive my 
curse!" Vasudeva smiled and said: "Peace, 
peace! Calm yourself. Do not use up the 
fruit of your great penances in this anger. 
Listen to what I say and then, if you like, 
you may pronounce your curse." 
Krishna pacified the indignant brahmana 
and appeared to him in his all-embracing 
form, the Viswarupa. 
"I am born in various bodies from time to 
time to save the world and establish the 
good. In whatever body I am born, I must 
act in conformity with the nature of that 
body. When I am born as a Deva, I act as 
a Deva does. If I appear as a Yaksha or as 
a Rakshasa, I do everything like a Yaksha 
or a Rakshasa. If I am born as a human 
being, or as a beast, I do what is natural to 
that birth and complete my task. I begged 
very hard of the ignorant Kauravas. They 
were arrogant and intoxicated by power 
and paid no heed to my advice. I tried to 
intimidate them. Therein also I failed. I 
was in wrath and showed them even my 
Viswarupa. Even that failed to have an 
effect. 
They 
persisted 
in 
wrongdoing. 
They waged war and perished. O best 
among brahmanas, you have no reason to 
be angry with me." 
After this explanation of Krishna, Utanga 
recovered 
his 
calm. 
Krishna 
was, 
delighted.  
"I wish to give a boon to you. What would 
you like?" said Krishna. 
"Achchyuta," 
said 
Utanga, 
"is 
it 
not 
enough I have seen Thee and Thy Form 
Universal? I do not desire any further 
boon." 
But 
Krishna 
insisted 
and 
the 
desert 
wandering simple brahmana said: "Well, 
my Lord, if you must give me some boon, 
let me find water to drink whenever I 
might feel thirsty. Give me this boon." 
Krishna smiled. "Is this all? Have it then," 
he said, and proceeded on his journey.  
One day Utanga was very thirsty and, 
unable to find water anywhere in the 
desert, he bethought himself of the boon 
he had received. 
As soon as be did this, a Nishada appeared 
before him, clothed in filthy rags. He had 
five hunting hounds in leash and a water-
skin strapped to his shoulder.  
The Nishada grinned at Utanga and 
saying, "You seem to be thirsty. Here is 
water for you," offered the bamboo spout 
of his water-skin to the brahmana to drink 
from.  
Utanga, looking at the man and his dogs 
and his water skin, said in disgust: 
"Friend, I do not need it, thank you." 
Saying this, he thought of Krishna and 
reproached him in his mind: "Indeed, was 
this all the boon you gave me?"  
The outcaste Nishada pressed Utanga over 
and over again to quench his thirst, but it 
only made Utanga more and more angry 
and he refused to drink. The hunter and 
his dogs disappeared. 
Seeing the strange disappearance of the 
Nishada, Utanga reflected: "Who was 
this? He could not have been a real 
Nishada. It was certainly a test and I have 
blundered 
miserably. 
My 
philosophy 
deserted me. I rejected the water offered 
by the Nishada and proved myself to be 
an arrogant fool."  
Utanga was in great anguish. A moment 
later 
Madhava 
himself 
appeared 
with 
conch and discus. "O Purushottama!" 
exclaimed Utanga; "you put me to a 
difficult trial. Was it right of you to try me 
thus? Make an untouchable offer unclean 
water to me, a brahmana, to drink. Was 
this kind?" asked Utanga. Utanga spoke in 
bitter tones.  
Janardana smiled. "O Utanga, for your 
sake, when you put my boon into action, I 
asked Indra to take amrita to you and give 
it to you as water. He said he could not 
give to a mortal what would give him 
immortality, while he was willing to do 
anything else. But I prevailed upon him 
and he agreed to take amrita and give it to 
you as water, provided I let him do it as a 
Chandala and tested your understanding 
and found you willing to take water from 
a Chandala. I accepted the challenge 
believing you had attained jnana and 
transcended externals. But you have done 
this and made me suffer defeat at Indra's 
hands." Utanga saw his mistake and was 
ashamed. 
101. A POUND OF FLOUR 
WHEN Yudhishthira was crowned and 
installed as king after the Kurukshetra 
battle, he performed an aswamedha yajna. 
As was the custom on occasions of this 
great horse sacrifice, all the princes of the 
land gathered on invitation and the yajna 
was completed in great splendor. The 
brahmanas and the poor and the destitute 
people, who had come in great numbers 
from all parts of the country, received 
bounteous gifts. Everything was done in 
magnificent style and in conformity With 
the injunctions relating to the sacrifice. 
From 
somewhere 
unseen, 
a 
weasel 
suddenly appeared right in the middle of 
the assembled guests and priests in the 
great pavilion and, after rolling on the 
ground laughed a loud human laugh as if 
in derision. The priests were alarmed at 
this strange and unnatural occurrence and 
wondered whether it was some evil spirit 
that had come to pollute and disturb the 
sacred rites. 
The weasel's body was on one side all 
shining gold. This remarkable creature 
turned round and took a good view of the 
assembly 
of 
princes 
and 
learned 
brahmanas that had come from various 
countries 
and 
gathered in that great 
pavilion and began to speak: 
"Princes assembled and priests, listen to 
me. You no doubt believe that you have 
completed your yajna in splendid style. 
Once upon a time, a poor brahmana who 
lived in Kurukshetra made a gift of a 
pound of maize flour. Your great horse 
sacrifice and all the gifts made in that 
connection are less than that small gift of 
the Kurukshetra brahmana. You seem to 
think too much of your yajna. Pray, be not 
so vain about it." 
The gathering was amazed at this strange 
and impertinent speech of the golden 
weasel. The brahmana priests, who had 
performed the sacrificial rites, went up to 
the weasel and spoke to it: 
"Wherefrom and why have you come to 
this yajna, performed by good and worthy 
men? Who are you? Why do you utter 
words of scorn about our sacrifice? This 
aswamedha has been duly completed in 
every detail in accordance with sastraic 
injunctions. It is not proper that you 
should speak derisively of our great 
sacrifice. Everyone that has come to this 
yajna has been duly attended to and has 
been accorded suitable honors and gifts. 
Everyone is pleased with the gifts and 
returns happy and contented. The mantras 
have been chanted perfectly and the 
oblations duly offered. The four castes are 
pleased. Why do you speak as you do? Do 
explain yourself." 
The weasel laughed again and said: "O 
brahmanas, what I said is true. I do not 
grudge 
the 
good 
fortune 
of 
king 
Yudhishthira or the good fortune of any of 
you. It is not envy that makes me say this. 
The yajna, which you have just completed 
so showily, is not in truth as great an act 
as that gift of the poor brahmana, which I 
have seen. And in reward for his gift, he 
and his wife, son and daughter-in-law 
were immediately taken to swarga. Listen 
to my story which is a true narrative of 
what I saw myself. Long before you 
waged your battle there, a brahmana, lived 
in Kurukshetra, who obtained his daily 
food by gleaning in the fields. He and his 
wife, son and daughter-in-law, all four 
lived in this manner. Everyday in the 
afternoon they would sit down and have 
their only meal for the day. On days when 
they failed to find enough grain, they 
would fast until the next afternoon. They 
would not keep over any thing for the next 
day if they got more than they required for 
the day. This was the strict unchhavritti 
discipline they had pledged themselves to 
observe. They passed their days thus for 
many years, when a great drought came 
and there was famine all over the land. All 
cultivation ceased and there was neither 
sowing nor harvesting nor any grain 
scattered in the fields to be gleaned. For 
many days the brahmana and his family 
starved. One day, after wandering in 
hunger and heat, with great difficulty they 
came home with a small quantity of 
maize, which they had gathered. They 
ground it and after saying their prayers 
they divided the flour into four equal parts 
and, offering thanks to God, sat down 
eagerly to eat. Just then, a brahmana 
entered and he was exceedingly hungry. 
Seeing an unexpected guest arrive, they 
got up and made due obeisance and asked 
him 
to 
join 
them. 
The 
pure-souled 
brahmana and his wife and son and 
daughter-in-law 
were 
exceedingly 
delighted to have the good fortune of 
receiving guest at that juncture. 'Oh best 
of brahmanas, I am a poor man. This flour 
of maize was obtained in accordance with 
dharma. Pray accept this. May blessings 
attend on you,' said the brahmana of 
Kurukshetra and gave his share of the 
flour to the guest. The guest ate it with 
avidity but he was still hungry when he 
had 
finished. 
Seeing 
his 
hungry 
and 
unsatisfied 
look, 
the 
brahmana 
was 
grieved and did not know what to do, 
when his wife said: 'Lord, give my share 
also to him. I shall be glad if the guest's 
hunger he satisfied.' Saying this, she 
handed her share of the flour to her 
husband to be given to the guest. 'Faithful 
one,' said the brahmana, 'the beasts and 
the birds and all the animals tend the 
females of their species with care. May 
man do worse? I cannot accept your 
suggestion. What shall I gain in this or in 
the other world if I leave you to starve and 
suffer hunger, you who help me and serve 
me to do the sacred duties of a 
householder's life? Beloved one, you are 
now skin and bone and famished and 
exceedingly hungry. How can I leave you 
to suffer in that condition and hope to 
attain any good by feeding the guest? No, 
I cannot accept your offer.' 'You are 
versed in the sastras, best of brahmanas', 
replied the wife. 'Is it not true that dharma, 
artha and all the objects of human activity 
are to the common and equal benefit of 
both of us who have been joined together? 
Do look on me with compassion and take 
my share of the flour and satisfy the 
requirements of this our guest. You are 
hungry as I am and you should not make 
any distinction between us. I entreat you 
not to deny my request.' The brahmana 
yielded and took the wife's share and gave 
it to the guest who took it greedily and ate 
it. But he was still hungry! Great was the 
distress 
of 
the 
poor 
brahmana 
of 
Kurukshetra. His son, who saw this, came 
forward. 'Father, here is my share,' said 
he. 'Give it to this guest who seems to be 
still hungry. I shall be indeed happy if we 
shall thus be able to fulfil our duty.' The 
father's 
distress 
increased. 
'Child!' 
he 
exclaimed, 'old men can stand starvation. 
Youth's hunger is severe. I am not able to 
find it in my heart to accept what you say.' 
The son insisted: 'it is the duty of the son 
to look after his father in his declining 
years. The son is not different from the 
father. Is it not said that the father is born 
afresh in his son? My share of the flour is 
yours in truth. I beg of you to accept what 
I give and feed this hungry guest.' 'Dear 
boy, your nobility and your mastery over 
the senses fill me with pride. Blessing on 
you. I shall accept your share!' said the 
father, and he took the son's flour and 
gave it to the guest to eat. The guest ate 
the third part of the flour also but he was 
still hungry! The brahmana, who lived on 
scattered grain, was confused. While he 
was in distress, not knowing that to do, his 
daughter-in-law 
addressed 
him 
thus: 
'Lord, I shall give my share too and gladly 
complete our efforts to feed this guest. I 
beg of you to accept it and bless me, your 
child, for, by that, I shall have eternal 
good as my reward.' The father-in-law 
was sad beyond measure. 'O girl of 
spotless character, pale and emaciated as 
you are from starvation, you propose to 
give your part of the food also to me, so 
that I may earn merit by giving it to this 
guest. If I accept your offer, I shall indeed 
be guilty of cruelty. How could I possibly 
look on when you wither in hunger?' The 
girl would not listen. 'Father, you are lord 
of my lord and master, preceptor of my 
preceptor, god of my god. I implore you 
to accept my flour. Is not this body of 
mine dedicated wholly to serve my lord? 
You should help me to attain the good. Do 
take this flour, I entreat you.' Thus 
implored 
by 
his 
daughter-in-law, 
the 
brahmana accepted her share of the flour 
and blessed her saying: 'Loyal girl, may 
every good be yours!' The guest received 
this last portion avidly and ate it and was 
satisfied. 
'Blessed 
is 
your 
hospitality, 
given with the purest intent and to the 
uttermost of your capacity. Your gift has 
leased me. Lo there, the gods are 
showering flowers in admiration of your 
extraordinary sacrifice. See the gods and 
the Gandharvas have come down in their 
bright chariots with their attendants to 
take you with your family to the happy 
regions above. Your gift has achieved 
swarga for you, as well as for your 
ancestors. 
Hunger 
destroys 
the 
understanding of men. It makes them go 
aside from the path of rectitude. It leads 
them to evil thoughts. The pious, when 
suffering the pangs of hunger, lose their 
steadfastness. But you have, even when 
hungry, bravely set aside your attachment 
to wife and son and placed dharma above 
all else. Rajasuya sacrifices and horse 
sacrifices completed in splendor, would 
pale into insignificance before the great 
sacrifice you have done through this 
single act of hospitality. The chariot is 
waiting for you. Enter and go to swarga, 
you and your family.' Saying this the 
mysterious guest disappeared." 
Having 
related 
this 
story 
of 
the 
Kurukshetra 
brahmana 
who 
lived 
by 
gleaning scattered ears of corn in the field, 
the weasel continued:  
"I was nearby and caught the fragrance 
wafted from that flour of the brahmana. It 
made my head all gold. I then went and 
rolled in joy on the ground where some of 
the flour had been scattered. It made one 
side of me into bright gold. I turned on the 
other side but there was no more flour left 
and that part of me is still as it was. 
Desirous of getting my body made all 
gold, I have been trying every place where 
men perform great yajnas and penances. I 
heard that Yudhishthira of world fame 
was performing a yajna and came here, 
believing that this sacrifice might come up 
to the standard. But I found it did not. So, 
I said that your great aswamedha was not 
so great as the loft of flour which that 
brahmana made to his guest." The weasel 
then disappeared. 
102. YUDHISHTHIRA RULES 
MAN pursues madly the object of his 
desire until it is got. When it is in his 
possession, he is soon satisfied, but he 
becomes the slave of ever-fresh longings 
and fresh griefs and finds no peace.  
Although to fight and to kill his enemies 
is a Kshatriyas dharma, what joy can one 
gets out of power and position and wealth 
acquired by slaughter and grief inflicted 
on brothers and near relations? It was this 
that Arjuna pointed out in his powerful 
plea before Krishna when the battle 
commenced. Krishna in answer, explained 
the principles of man's activities and the 
proper discharge of one's duties. But, what 
Arjuna felt and argued had also a great 
deal of force and there was more truth in it 
than appeared on the surface.  
The Pandavas defeated the Kauravas and 
became the unquestioned sovereigns of 
the land. They took up their duties and 
discharged them according to dharma. 
But, they found not in victory, the joy that 
they had expected.  
"When the Pandavas won and obtained 
the 
kingdom, 
how 
did 
they 
treat 
Dhritarashtra?" asked king Janamejaya, 
and Vaisampayana, who recited Vyasa's 
Mahabharata to the king, tells the story. 
The Pandavas with the utmost respect 
treated Dhritarashtra, who was plunged in 
a sea of grief. They tried to make him 
happy. They did nothing to make him feel 
humiliated. Yudhishthira issued no orders 
except with his approval. Gandhari, whose 
hundred sons had disappeared like dream-
gold, was looked after by Kuntidevi with 
loving and sisterly devotion and Draupadi 
dutifully ministered to them both, with 
equal respect.  
Yudhishthira 
furnished 
Dhritarashtra's 
house with rich seats and beds and 
decorations and all else that was wanted. 
He sent from the royal kitchen most 
dainty and palatable dishes prepared for 
him. Kripacharya, lived with Dhritarashtra 
and kept him company. Vyasa comforted 
him 
with 
instructive 
stories 
of 
olden 
times, calculated to assuage his sorrow.  
In the administration of affairs of the 
State, 
Yudhishthira 
consulted 
Dhritarashtra and conducted himself so as 
to give him the feeling that in truth the 
kingdom was ruled on his behalf and that 
he, as the eldest member of the family, 
was still the supreme authority.  
Yudhishthira was most careful in his 
speech, never to allow himself to say 
anything to cause pain to the bereaved old 
man. 
The 
princes, 
who 
came 
to 
Hastinapura from all parts of the world, 
gave Dhritarashtra the same honors; as 
they did of old, as if he were still the 
emperor.  
The women attendants gave Gandhari no 
occasion 
to 
feel 
her 
fallen 
estate. 
Yudhishthira had instructed his brothers 
most strictly that nothing should be done 
to cause the slightest pain to their uncle, 
who had lost all his sons.  
The brothers, with perhaps the exception 
of 
Bhima, 
followed 
this 
injunction 
faithfully. 
Dhritarashtra 
too 
conducted 
himself lovingly towards the Pandavas. 
He showed no ill will towards them even 
as they showed him no unkindness. The 
Pandavas 
behaved 
unexceptionably 
towards their old uncle. After a time, 
however, Bhima began on occasions to 
give 
cause 
for 
offence. 
He 
would 
sometimes, 
in 
impatience, 
countermand 
the old man's instructions. He would let 
fall in Dhritarashtra's hearing words like 
"Those perverse cousins of ours have 
themselves to thank for their destruction."  
It was not possible for Bhima to forget or 
forgive Duryodhana, Karna or Duhsasana. 
Gandhari felt intensely grieved when she 
noticed that Bhima uttered words, which 
pained Dhritarashtra. She was, however, a 
noble and enlightened soul. Whenever she 
felt pained at what Bhima said, she would 
look at Kunti and find peace. For Kunti 
was a veritable embodiment of dharma 
and inspired forbearance. Fifteen years 
passed in this manner. 
103. DHRITARASHTRA 
FIFTEEN 
years 
passed 
under 
king 
Yudhishthira's 
reign, 
when 
old 
Dhritarashtra found himself utterly unable 
any longer to bear the burden of grief.  
Hurt by Bhima's occasional reproaches, he 
found no heart to accept the courtesies and 
comforts 
provided 
under 
king 
Yudhishthira's orders. Unknown to the 
Pandavas, 
he 
secretly 
fasted 
and 
underwent hard penances.  
Gandhari too observed manifests and 
inflicted privation on her. And one day 
Dhritarashtra sent for Dharmaputra and 
spoke to him thus: 
"Son, blessings on you. I have spent 
fifteen happy years under your roof. You 
have tended me most lovingly. I have 
made gifts and offerings to ancestors and 
fulfilled all my desires in that respect. 
Bereaved Gandhari, laying aside her own 
grief, has ministered to my physical wants 
all these years. My cruel sons, who 
committed 
unforgivable 
wrong 
to 
Draupadi and deprived you of your lawful 
inheritance, perished on account of their 
sins. But they fought like brave soldiers 
and died in the battlefield and have gone 
to the happy regions reserved for the 
brave. The time has come when with 
Gandhari I must do what has to be done 
for our next state. You know what the 
sastras have lain down. I must now go to 
the forest. These robes must be replaced 
by bark and tattered old clothes, suitable 
for the life of Vanaprastha. I desire to go 
and live in the forest, praying for your 
good. I want your permission for this. Let 
me follow the practice of our fathers. As 
king, you will share in the fruits of my 
penance." 
Yudhishthira received a shock when he 
saw Dhritarashtra and heard him say this. 
"I did not know," he said, "that you had 
been fasting and sleeping on the bare 
ground and mortifying your flesh in this 
manner. My brothers too were unaware of 
this. I was misled into believing you were 
well looked after and happy. Father, you 
have suffered grief, for which there can be 
no solace. I see no good in kingdom or 
pleasures. I am a sinner. Desire and 
ambition deceived me into this. Let your 
son Yuyutsu be king, or anyone else you 
choose. Or if you will do so, you yourself 
may take up the duties of king and look 
after the people. I shall go to the forest. 
Let me terminate this chapter of error. I 
implore you to save me from further 
obloquy and burning shame. I am not the 
king. You are the king. You ask me for 
permission to go. How then can I give or 
refuse permission to you? Let me assure 
you that my anger against Duryodhana is 
a thing of the past, gone without a trace. 
Fate willed it and engulfed us all in 
confusion of mind. And events happened 
which were not in our control. We are 
your children, even like Duryodhana and 
his brothers. Gandhari and Kunti is alike 
mother to me and command equal regard 
and filial affection from me, their child. If 
you go away to the forest, I must go with 
you and serve you there. If you retire to 
the woods and leave me here, what joy 
shall I have in kingship? I prostrate myself 
before you and implore you to forgive the 
errors we have been guilty of. Serving you 
will give me true joy and peace of mind. 
Give me that opportunity and privilege. 
Do not desert me." 
Dhritarashtra was deeply moved. But he 
said: "Kunti's beloved son, my mind is 
fixed on going to the forest and on 
penance. I can find no peace otherwise 
now. I have lived under your roof for 
many years. You and all your people have 
served me with unstinted devotion. You 
must permit me now to fulfil my wish and 
let me go." 
Having thus spoken to Yudhishthira, who 
stood with clasped hands and trembling 
with 
agitation, 
Dhritarashtra turned to 
Vidura and Kripacharya: "I beg of you to 
comfort the king and make him grant my 
prayer. My mind is fixed on the forest. I 
am unable to speak any more. I am feeling 
dry in my throat. Perhaps, it is due to age. 
I have talked too much. I am tired." 
Saying 
this, 
he 
leaned 
helplessly 
on 
Gandhari and swooned.  
Yudhishthira was unable to bear this 
distress of the grand old man, who had 
possessed the sinews of an elephant and 
had had strength enough to crush the 
metal figure of Bhima into powder.  
How lean he had become now and 
emaciated, 
with 
his 
bones 
showing 
through 
his 
skin, 
piteously 
leaning 
senseless on Gandhari like one destitute.  
"Have I caused all this?" he reproached 
himself. "Miserable and unworthy am I, 
ignorant 
of 
dharma, 
devoid 
of 
intelligence. A curse on my learning!"  
He sprinkled water on Dhritarashtra's face 
and caressingly stroked him with his soft 
hands.  
When the old man recovered, he tenderly 
clasped the Pandava to his bosom and 
muttered: "My dear boy, how sweet is 
your touch! I am happy."  
Then Vyasa entered. When he was 
acquainted with what had happened, he 
said to Yudhishthira:  
"Do what Dhritarashtra, eldest of the 
Kurus, desires. Let him go to the forest. 
He is old. All his sons have gone before 
him. It is not possible for him much 
longer to bear his grief. Gandhari, whom 
God has blessed with enlightenment, has 
borne her sorrows with courage. Do not 
stand in the way of their wishes. Let not 
Dhritarashtra pine away and die here. Let 
him go and live among the honeyladen 
flowers of the forest and breathe their 
fragrance, leaving the cares of the world 
behind. The dharma of kings is to die in 
battle or to spend their last days in 
retirement in the forest. Dhritarashtra has 
ruled the kingdom and performed yajnas. 
When you were in the wilderness for 
thirteen years, he enjoyed the wide earth 
through his son and gave bounteous gifts. 
You left him nothing to desire. The time 
has come for him to do penance. Let him 
go with your hearty consent, and without 
anger in his heart." 
Dharmaraja said: "So be it!"  
Then Vyasa returned to his hermitage. 
104. THE PASSING AWAY OF THE 
THREE 
WHEN Yudhishthira at last gave his 
consent for Dhritarashtra's retirement to 
the forest, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari 
went back to their residence and broke 
their fast.  
Kunti sat with Gandhari and they ate 
together. Dhritarashtra asked Yudhishthira 
to sit by him and gave him his last 
blessings.  
Then the old man stepped out and, with 
his hand resting on Gandhari's shoulder, 
slowly walked out of the city on his 
journey to the forest. 
Gandhari, who, because her lord and 
husband was blind, gave up the use of her 
eyes and wrapped her face with a cloth all 
her life, placed her hand on Kunti's 
shoulder and slowly walked along, thus 
guided. 
Kunti had decided in her mind to go with 
Gandhari to the forest. As she walked on, 
she was speaking to Yudhishthira: "Son, 
do not ever let your speech be angry when 
you speak to Sahadeva. Remember with 
love Karna who died a hero's death on the 
battlefield. 
He 
was 
my 
son, 
but 
I 
committed the crime of not disclosing it to 
you. Look after Draupadi with unfailing 
tenderness. Do not ever give cause for 
grief to Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and 
Sahadeva. Keep this ever in mind, son. 
The burden of the family is now wholly 
on you." 
Dharmaputra had till then believed that 
Kunti was accompanying Gandhari only 
for a distance to say goodbye. When he 
heard her speak thus, he was taken aback 
and was speechless for a few minutes.  
When he recovered from the shock he 
said: "Mother, not thus! You blessed us 
and sent us to battle. It is not right you 
should now desert us and go to the forest." 
Yudhishthira's entreaties were however of 
no avail. Kunti held to her purpose. 
"I must join my lord and husband 
wherever he be now. I shall be with 
Gandhari and go through the discipline of 
forest life and soon join your father. Go 
back unagitated. Return to the city. May 
your mind ever stand steady on dharma." 
Thus did Kunti bless her illustrious son 
and depart. 
Yudhishthira stood speechless. Kunti went 
on her way, looking back occasionally at 
him and her other sons.  
Each with hand on the shoulder of the 
other, this picture of the three elders of the 
tribe wending their way to the forest, 
leaving their sons behind, is painted by 
the poet so vividly that it fills the reader 
with solemn grief, as if the parting 
happened in his own family now. 
Dhritarashtra, Gandhari and Kunti spent 
three years in the forest. Sanjaya was with 
them. 
When 
one 
day, 
Dhritarashtra 
finished his ablutions and returned to their 
hermitage, the forest had caught fire.  
The wind blew and the flames spread 
everywhere. The deer and the wild boars 
ran in herds hither and thither, and rushed 
madly to the pools.  
Dhritarashtra told Sanjaya: "This fire will 
envelop us all. You had better save 
yourself."  
Saying this, the blind old king, Gandhari 
with her eves blindfolded and Kunti sat 
down on the ground, the three of them, 
facing eastwards in yoga posture and 
calmly gave themselves up to the flames. 
Sanjaya, who had been to the blind king, 
throughout all his days, his only light and 
was dear to him like life itself, spent the 
rest of his days in the Himalayas as a 
sanyasin. 
105. KRISHNA PASSES AWAY 
KRISHNA ruled at Dwaraka for thirty-six 
years after the Kurukshetra battle was 
over.  The Vrishnis, the Bhopas and other 
branches of the Yadavas belonging to 
Krishna's 
tribe 
spent 
their 
days 
in 
unrestrained 
self-indulgence and luxury. 
They lost all sense of discipline and 
humility. 
Once, some rishis came to Dwaraka. The 
arrogant and irreverent Yadavas mocked 
these rishis with a practical joke. They 
dressed up one of their young men like a 
woman and, presenting him to the revered 
guests, said: "O ye learned men, tell us 
whether this lady will have a boy or a 
girl." 
The rishis saw through the irreverent joke 
and said in anger: "This person will give 
birth to a mace, not a boy or a girl and that 
mace will prove to be Yama to your tribe 
and destroy you all." The rishis departed 
after pronouncing this curse. 
The 
foolish 
Yadavas 
were 
rather 
perturbed at this unpleasant ending of 
what they had thought was a good joke.  
Next day, they were in consternation to 
see that Samba, the man who had been 
dressed up in female clothes, developed 
labor pains and lo and behold, gave birth 
to a mace! This filled them with terror 
because they felt that their end was near 
as the rishis had cursed. 
They deliberated long and finally ground 
the mace to fine powder, which they 
scattered in the sea, and thought they, had 
thus disposed of the danger.  
Nothing happened for some time. Seasons 
passed. The rains came and on the beach, 
near where they had strewn the fine dust 
of the awful club, there sprang up a dense, 
crop of rushes.  
When the Yadavas saw this, they were 
curious 
and 
amused, 
for 
they 
had 
forgotten all about the curse of the revered 
guests. 
One day, long after, the Yadavas went to 
the beach for a picnic and spent the whole 
day in dance and drink and revelry. The 
liquor began to work.  
At first merry, then pugnacious, they 
began to talk without restrain, raking up 
old offences and quarrelling, on slight 
cause with one another. Among the 
Yadavas, Kritavarma had fought on the 
side of the Kauravas and Satyaki on that 
of the Pandavas.  
"Would any Kshatriya attack and kill 
sleeping soldiers, O Kritavarma? You 
have brought a great and lasting disgrace 
on 
our tribe," said Satyaki, taunting 
Kritavarma, and a number of drunken 
Yadavas applauded the attack. Kritavarma 
could not bear the insult.  
"Like a butcher, you slaughtered the great 
Bhurisravas when seated in yoga after his 
right hand was cut off and you, coward, 
dare to taunt me," he exclaimed and a 
number of the revelers joined him and 
began to scoff at Satyaki for his barbarous 
deed. 
Soon, all the Yadavas were in the quarrel 
on one side or the other and presently 
from words they came to blows, which 
swiftly developed into a free fight.  
Satyaki, with his sword drawn, sprang 
upon Kritavarma and cut his head off, 
exclaiming: "Here is the end of the 
coward who killed sleeping soldiers! " 
Others immediately fell upon Satyaki with 
their 
drinking 
bowls 
and 
pots 
and 
anything they could lay hands upon.  
Pradyumna, Krishna's son, joined the fray 
to rescue Satyaki and there was a 
desperate melee in which both Satyaki 
and Pradyumna were killed.  
Krishna knew that the destined hour was 
come, and plucking the tall rushes, which 
fringed the beach, laid about him with 
them indiscriminately.  
This led to every one of the Yadavas 
doing the same and there was great 
indiscriminate slaughter. The rishis' curse 
had begun to work. 
The rushes that had grown out of the mace 
became each one of them a mace as it was 
plucked by the doomed men in their 
unreasonable fury. They used them on one 
another with deadly effect and soon all of 
them were destroyed in this drunken 
brawl. 
Balarama, who was seeing all this, was 
overwhelmed with shame and disgust and 
sank to the ground. He gave up his life as 
he lay in a yoga trance. Balarama passed 
away into the ocean in a stream of light, 
which issued from his forehead like a 
silver serpent. Thus ended the avatar of 
Narayana in Balarama.  
Krishna saw all his people thus destroy 
themselves as predestined. When he saw 
the passing of Balarama, he roamed about 
in deep meditation in the wilderness, 
pondering on the completion of his avatar. 
"The time has come for me to go," he said 
to himself and, lying on the ground fell 
asleep.  
In that wooded beach, a hunter, prowling 
for game, saw Vasudeva lying on the 
ground 
among 
the 
shrubs. 
From 
a 
distance, the hunter mistook Krishna for a 
wild animal resting on the ground. 
He bent his bow and shot an arrow at the 
prostrate figure which, piercing his foot in 
the insteep, went full through his body. 
Thus did the great Vasudeva depart from 
the world of men. 
106. YUDHISHTHIRA'S FINAL 
TRIAL 
To Hastinapura came the sad tidings of 
the death of Vasudeva and the destruction 
of the Yadavas. When the Pandavas 
received the news, they lost all remaining 
attachment to life on earth.  
They 
crowned 
Parikshit, 
son 
ofAbhimanyu, as emperor and the five 
brothers left the city with Draupadi. They 
went out on a pilgrimage, visiting holy 
places and finally reached the Himalayas.  
A dog joined them somewhere and kept 
them company all along. And the seven of 
them climbed the mountain on their last 
pilgrimage. 
As 
they 
toiled 
up 
the 
mountain path one by one fell exhausted 
and died.  
The youngest succumbed first. Draupadi, 
Sahadeva and Nakula were released from 
the burden of the flesh one after another. 
Then followed Arjuna and then great 
Bhima too.  
Yudhishthira saw his dear ones fall and 
die. Yet, serenely he went on not giving 
way to grief, for the light of Truth burned 
bright 
before 
him. 
Yudhishthira 
knew 
what 
was 
shadow 
and 
what 
was 
substance.  
The dog still followed Yudhishthira. The 
lesson enforced by the poet in this episode 
of the dog is that dharma is the only 
constant companion in life's journey.  
It was dharma who, in the shape of the 
dog, 
followed 
Yudhishthira 
up 
the 
wearisome 
mountain 
path, 
when 
his 
brothers and wife had gone leaving him 
alone. 
Finally, when he reached a great height, 
Indra appeared in his chariot. 
"Your brothers and Draupadi have arrived 
before you. You have lagged behind, 
burdened with your body. Ascend my 
chariot and go with me in the flesh. I have 
come to take you," said Indra. But when 
Yudhishthira went up to take his seat in 
Indra's chariot, the dog also climbed up.  
"No, no," said Indra. "There is no place 
for dogs in swarga," and pushed the dog 
away.  
"Then there is no room for me either," 
said Yudhishthira, and refused to enter the 
heavenly chariot if he had to leave his 
faithful companion behind.  
Dharma had come to test Yudhishthira's 
loyalty and he was pleased with his son's 
conduct. The dog vanished from sight. 
Yudhishthira reached swarga. There, he 
saw Duryodhana.  
The Kuru prince was seated on a beautiful 
throne and he shone with the splendor of 
the 
sun 
and 
around 
him 
stood 
in 
attendance the goddess of heroism and 
other angels. He did not see his brothers 
or 
anyone 
else. 
Yudhishthira 
was 
astonished.  
"Where are my brothers, ye denizens of 
swarga?" asked Yudhishthira. "This man 
of greed, of limited vision, is here. I do 
not care to spend my time in his company. 
We were driven by this man's envy and 
spite to kill friends and relatives. We 
stood tied by dharma to inaction when, 
before our eyes, innocent Panchali, united 
to us in sacred wedlock, was dragged to 
the Hall of the Assembly and insulted 
under the orders of this wicked man. I 
cannot bear the sight of this man. Tell me, 
where are my brothers? I wish to go 
where they are." Saying this Yudhishthira 
averted his eyes from where Duryodhana 
was seated in glory.  
Then 
Narada, 
the 
heavenly 
rishi 
of 
encyclopedic 
knowledge, 
smiled 
disapprovingly at Yudhishthira and said: 
"Renowned prince, this is not right. In 
swarga, we harbor no ill will. Do not 
speak in this manner about Duryodhana. 
The brave Duryodhana has attained his 
present state by force of kshatriya dharma. 
It is not right to let the things of the flesh 
stay in the mind and breed ill will. Do 
follow the law and stay here with king 
Duryodhana. There is no place in swarga 
for hatred. You have arrived here with 
your human body; so it is that you have 
these 
inappropriate 
feelings. 
Discard 
them, son!"  
Yudhishthira replied:  
"O sage, Duryodhana, who did not know 
right from wrong, who was a sinner, who 
caused suffering to good men, who fed 
enmity and anger and who brought death 
to countless men, has attained this swarga 
of warriors. Where is that region of 
greater glory, which must be the abode of 
my 
brave 
and 
good 
brothers 
and 
Draupadi? I am eager to see them and 
Karna, and also all the friends and princes 
who gave up their lives in battle for me. I 
do not see them here. I desire to meet 
again Virata, Drupada, Dhrishtaketu and 
Sikhandin, the Panchala prince. I long to 
see the dear sons of Draupadi and 
Abhimanyu. I do not see them here. 
Where are they, who threw their bodies 
into the blazing fire of battle for my sake, 
like ghee in the sacrifice? I do not see any 
of them here. Where are they all? My 
place must be among them. At the close of 
the battle, my mother Kunti wanted me to 
offer libations for Karna also. When I 
think of it, even now, grief overwhelms 
me. In ignorance of his being my own 
blood brother, I caused Karna to be slain. 
I am eager to see him. Bhima, dearer to 
me than life, Arjuna, who was like Indra 
him self, the twins Nakula and Sahadeva 
and 
our 
dear 
Panchali, 
steadfast 
in 
dharma, I long to see and be with them all. 
I do not wish to be in heaven, for what 
good is it for me to be here, away from 
my brothers? Wherever they may be, that 
me is swarga; not this place!"  
The angels, who heard this, replied:  
"O Yudhishthira, if you indeed desire to 
be with them, by all means, you may go at 
once. There is no need to delay," and they 
ordered an attendant to take Yudhishthira.  
So, the messenger proceeded in front and 
Yudhishthira followed him. As they went 
along, it soon became dark and in the 
gathering gloom could be dimly seen 
things weird and revolting.  
He waded through slippery slime of blood 
and offal. The path was strewn with 
carrion and bones and dead men's hair. 
Worms were wriggling everywhere and 
there was an insufferable stench in the air. 
He 
saw 
mutilated 
human 
bodies 
everywhere. 
Yudhishthira was horrified and confused. 
A thousand thoughts tortured his mind as 
he proceeded. 
"How far have we to go yet on this road? 
Where indeed are my brothers? Tell me, 
my friend," he enquired of the messenger 
in deep anguish. 
The messenger quietly replied: "If you so 
desire, we may turn back." The foul odors 
of the place were so sickening that for a 
moment Yudhishthira was minded to go 
back.  
But just then, as if divining his intention, 
vaguely familiar voices rose all around in 
loud lamentation. "O Dharmaputra, do not 
go back! Stay here for a few minutes at 
least. 
Your 
presence 
has 
given 
us 
momentary relief from torture. As you 
came, you have brought with you a whiff 
of air so sweet and pure that we have 
found a little relief in our agony. Son of 
Kunti, the very sight of you gives us 
comfort and mitigates our suffering. O 
stay, be it for ever so short a time. Do not 
go back. While you are here, we enjoy a 
respite in our torture." Thus the voices 
pleaded.  
Hearing the loud lamentations that thus 
came from all around him, Yudhishthira 
stood 
in 
painful 
bewilderment. 
Overwhelmed with pity at the poignant 
anguish in faintly remembered voices, he 
exclaimed:  
"Alas wretched souls! Who are ye that 
lament like this? Why are you here?" 
"Lord, I am Karna," said a voice. 
"I am Bhima," said another. 
"I am Arjuna," cried a third voice. 
"Draupadi," cried another voice in piteous 
tone. 
"I am Nakula," "I am Sahadeva," "We are 
Draupadi's 
sons," 
and 
so 
on, 
came 
mournful voices from all around, till the 
accumulated 
pain 
was 
more 
that 
Yudhishthira could bear. 
"What sin indeed have these been guilty 
of?" 
cried 
he. 
"Dhritarashtra's 
son 
Duryodhana, what good deeds did he do 
to sit like Mahendra in heaven, while 
these are in hell? Am I dreaming or am I 
awake? Is my mind deranged? Have I 
gone crazy?" 
Overwhelmed 
by 
anger, 
Yudhishthira 
cursed the gods and denounced dharma. 
He turned to the angel attendant and said 
sharply: "Go back to your masters. I shall 
stay here where my dear brothers, for no 
other sin than devotion to me, are 
consigned to the tortures of hell. Let me 
be with them."  
The messenger went back and conveyed 
to Indra what Yudhishthira had said. 
Thus passed the thirteenth part of a day. 
Then Indra and Yama appeared before 
Yudhishthira where he stood in anguish. 
When they came, the darkness rolled 
away and the horrid sights disappeared. 
The sinners and their suffering were no 
more to be seen. A fragrant breeze blew as 
Yama, the god of dharma, smiled on his 
son Yudhishthira.  
"Wisest of men, this is the third time I 
have tested you. You chose to remain in 
hell for the sake of your brothers. It is 
inevitable that kings and rulers must go 
through hell if only for a while. So it was 
that for the thirtieth part of a day you too 
were doomed to suffer the pangs of hell. 
Neither 
the 
illustrious 
Savyasachi 
(Arjuna) nor your beloved brother Bhima 
is really in hell. Nor Karna the just, nor 
anyone else who you thought had been 
consigned to suffering. It was an illusion 
designed to test you. This is not hell, but 
swarga. Do you not see there Narada 
whose travels cover the three worlds? 
Cease grieving." 
Thus said Yama to Dharmaputra, who, 
thereupon, was transfigured. The mortal 
frame was gone and he was a god. With 
the disappearance of the human body, also 
disappeared all trace of anger and hatred.  
Then Yudhishthira saw their Karna and all 
his brothers and the sons of Dhritarashtra 
also, serene and free from anger, all 
having attained the state of the gods. In 
this reunion, Yudhishthira at last found 
peace and real happiness.
